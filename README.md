Apps should try to pull the metadata as infrequently as possible. ``IndexVersion.json`` is only 37 bytes and by comparing its time field you will always know if your cached copy is up to date. The date can be generated with ``date +%s``.

``data/SampleData.json`` contains a sample data file that can be used as a template for creating new event data files.

``IndexVersion.json`` contains the datestamp (in POSIX seconds) of the last metadata update. This is automatically generated by ``./update.sh``

Dates
------

Dates are always Month/Day/Year
