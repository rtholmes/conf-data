      "Abstract": "A goal of programming language researches is to establish a method of developing efficient and correct programs with ease. However, it is generally difficult to chase these rabbits. Efficient programs are usually complicated and hence difficult to see correctness. In this talk, we study an approach to this problem based on program transformations. Program transformations enable us to derive complex programs from naive but apparently correct ones in a \u201ccorrect by construction\u201d manner. We see effectiveness of program transformations through examples, including deforestation, program inversion, and program parallelization.",

      "Abstract": "We give a short description of a very simple programming language, with a simple typing system that features explicit dependent and polymorphic I/O effects. This system having been inspired by type and effect systems allows types to express what I/O operations the typed program possibly performs. The aim of this system is not to provide a way to prove functional correctness of programs with I/O effects but rather demonstrate and argue that a simple type and effect system can allow us to get an upper bound on the I/O operations that a program performs. We present illustrative examples shedding light on possible uses of such a system. We briefly discuss possible directions for further work.",

      "Abstract": "Arguments about linearizability of a concurrent data structure are typically carried out by specifying the linearization points of the data structure\u2019s procedures. Proofs that use such specifications are often cumbersome as the linearization points\u2019 position in time can be dynamic, non-local and non-regional: it can depend on the interference, run-time values and events from the past, or even future, appear in procedures other than the one considered, and might be only determined after the considered procedure has terminated. In this paper we propose a new method, based on a Hoare-style logic, for reasoning about concurrent objects with such linearization points. We embrace the dynamic nature of linearization points, and encode it as part of the data structure\u2019s auxiliary state, so that it can be dynamically modified in place by auxiliary code, as needed when some appropriate run-time event occurs. We name the idea linking-in-time, because it reduces temporal reasoning to spatial reasoning. For example, modifying a temporal position of a linearization point can be modeled similarly to a pointer update in a heap. We illustrate the method by verifying an intricate optimal snapshot algorithm due to Jayanti.",

On top of understanding the semantics of JavaScript, it requires modeling of web documents, platform objects, and interactions between them. Not only JavaScript itself but also its usage patterns are extremely dynamic. Most of web applications load JavaScript code dynamically, which makes pure static analysis approaches inapplicable.\nIn this talk, we present our attempts to analyze JavaScript web applications in the wild mostly statically using various approaches. From pure JavaScript programs to JavaScript web applications using platform-specific libraries, we explain technical challenges in analyzing each of them and how we built an open-source analysis framework for JavaScript, SAFE, that addresses the challenges incrementally.",

      "Abstract": "Sophisticated domain-specific and user-defined notation is widely used in formal models, but is poorly supported by proof assistants. This notation provides informal extensions to formal model that aid in communicating and reasoning about key ideas. Unfortunately, proof assistants do not allows users to conveniently define sophisticated notation. For instance, in modeling a programming language, we often define infix relations such as Γ ⊢ e : t and use BNF notation to specify the syntax of the language. In a proof assistant like Coq or Agda, users can easily define the notation for Γ ⊢ e : t , but to use BNF notation the user must use a preprocessing tool external to the proof assistant, which is cumbersome. To support sophisticated user-defined notation, we propose to use language extension as a fundamental part of the design of a proof assistant. We describe how to design a proof assistant that support safe, convenient, and sophisticated user-defined extensions, and show how language extension gives users the power to implement features of contemporary proof assistants.",

      "Abstract": "Algebraic effect handlers are recently gaining in popularity as a purely functional approach to modeling effects. As a restriction on general monads, algebraic effects come with various advantages: they can be freely composed, and there is a natural separation between their interface (as a set of operations) and their semantics (as a handler).\nIn this talk, I give an end-to-end overview of practical algebraic effects in the context of a compiled implementation in the Koka language. I\u2019ll present a language design for algebraic effects, and show how algebraic effects subsume many control-flow constructs that are specialized in other languages, e.g. exceptions, state, iterators, async-await, etc. In particular, iterators and async-await are complex constructs that can lead to subtle interactions with other features and require complex compilation mechanisms. Being able to generalize over them using a single well-founded abstraction is a huge win.\nFinally, I\u2019ll briefly discuss an effective type inference algorithm based on extensible effect rows using scoped labels, a direct operational semantics. and an efficient compilation scheme to common runtime platforms (such as JavaScript, the JVM, or .NET) using a type directed selective CPS translation.",

      "Abstract": "Administrative normal form (ANF) promises to reap the benefits of continuation-passing style (CPS) while retaining the advantages of direct style. However, we believe ANF falls short of this ideal because it does not provide a satisfactory way to describe shared control flow, as CPS does naturally. We show how CPS itself can guide us in adding a control effect to ANF and taming it to regain purity, guaranteeing an efficient implementation. Interestingly, even though CPS is usually used for compiling call-by-value languages, our technique is independent of the evaluation strategy. In short, we propose that the known advantages of CPS can be achieved by extending ANF, or in general a direct-style representation. Does this mean that CPS is finally out? No: whatever the compiler\u2019s chosen representation, we suspect CPS will reveal new insights about program manipulation.",

      "Abstract": "Algebraic effects were originally introduced to study the semantics of computational effects. With the addition of handlers they have become an exciting new programming construct for implementing such effects. Languages such as Eff have demonstrated that handlers can be used as a more composable alternative to monads for implementing effects in a pure language.\nOCaml provides many standard effects, such as mutable state, built into the language. Those effects not built into the language, for example concurrency, are traditionally implemented using monads. The first part of this talk will describe work to implement native algebraic effects for OCaml. The original motivation for this work was to provide built-in support for concurrency in OCaml without tying the language to a particular concurrency implementation. However, algebraic effects support many interesting examples beyond concurrency.\nAs with exceptions, algebraic effects risk being performed in a context where they will not be handled. Type systems designed to track the side-effects of expressions have been around for many years, and seem eminently suitable for ensuring all algebraic effects are appropriately handled. Recent developments in languages such as Koka have begun to produce effect systems that are genuinely usable, but they have yet to breakthrough into a more mainstream language. The second part of this talk will describe work to integrate an effect system into OCaml whilst maintaining backwards compatibility. This system both prevents effects from going unhandled and turns OCaml into a pure functional language: successfully tracking the purity of functions through their types.\nThe talk will discuss the interesting questions and challenges that still remain before this work is ready for release into OCaml.\nThis is joint work with Stephen Dolan, Matija Pretnar and KC Sivaramakrishnan.",

      "Abstract": "It is not always easy to correct a type error especially for novice programmers. When a type error occurs, the compiler shows a type error message, but often, it does not show the true cause of the type error. Why? Because it is impossible in general. Without knowing the intention of the programmer, the compiler cannot choose a single cause among multiple possible causes of the type error.\nTo locate the true cause of a type error, we have built an interactive type debugger for OCaml that incorporates programmer\u2019s intention. When a type error occurs, the type debugger asks a series of questions to the programmer. By correctly answering these questions, we are lead to the true source of the type error.\nIn this talk, I will first introduce the principle of the type debugger and show how a simple but crucial idea leads to a practicable type debugger. I then describe requirements and challenges for such a tool to be effective in the real use cases, such as in a classroom.",

We start with full ground references \u2014 which can refer to ground values and (recursively) ground references \u2014 where types denotes set-valued presheaves. By considering stores as mixed-variance set-valued functors (i.e., profunctors), we obtain two monads for full ground state which can interpret alloction, dereference, and mutation of full ground references, while validating the usual equations. We use this structure to give a denotational semantics to a monadic metalanguage with a special construct for effect masking similar to Haskell\u2019s runST. Time permitting, we speculate how to extend this approach, using an appropriate recursive domain equation, to account for ML-like general reference cells.",

Dependent types are the basis of proof assistants such as Agda, Coq, Idris, Twelf, and NuPRL, and various forms of dependency are making their way into more mainstream languages such as Haskell and OCaml. Dependent type theory has applications to program verification, computer-checked mathematical proofs, programming language metatheory and compiler verification, generic programming, and many other areas of programming and programming languages research. Some research projects in dependent types are very mathematical, studying enrichments of the basic systems of dependent type theory \u2013 for example, to better integrate effectful programming, or to better describe some mathematical concept that is to be formalized. Other projects are more engineering, such as building a large verified software artifact or mathematical proof using existing proof assistants.

      "Abstract": "Programming language research is largely the study of properties of programs, but reasoning about such properties presupposes programs have some meaning. Consequently, most papers in the area of programming languages start by establishing what programs mean, i.e., they define a semantics. There are several forms of semantics, but the most common form found in current PL papers is that of operational semantics. Operational semantics defines the meaning of a program by explaining its behavior in terms of a hypothetical computer which performs the set of actions which constitute the evaluation of that program. These \u201chypothetical computers\u201d can range from the very abstract, bearing little resemblance to what you might think of as a physical computer, to the very concrete, amenable to implementation on common hardware.\nThe goal of this talk will be to convey the basic machinery of operational semantics needed to read and understand ICFP papers.",

      "Abstract": "Recently we have seen a renewed interest in programming languages that tame the complexity of state and concurrency through refined type systems with more fine-grained control over effects. In addition to simplifying reasoning and eliminating whole classes of bugs, statically controlling effects opens the door to advanced compiler optimisations, such as automatic parallelisation. The flip-side of this refined typing is that these languages often have to include trusted library code that violate the static typing discipline, in ways that are claimed to be unobservable to clients. In this paper we define a logical relation for a language with an ML-like type system refined with effect annotations that supports reasoning about contextual equivalence of potentially ill-typed terms. Using this relation we can formally justify such claims about breaking typing in unobservable ways. The logical relation also supports type-based optimizations, such as automatically parallelizing expressions whose effects are suitably disjoint. The logical relation is defined in Iris, a state-of-the-art higher-order separation logic. This allows us to fall back to a powerful program logic to prove semantic well-typedness in cases where the static typing discipline is too imprecise.",

      "Abstract": "Learning to write well is an essential part of becoming a successful researcher. Unfortunately, many researchers find it very hard to write well because they do not know how to view their text from the perspective of the reader. In this talk, we present a simple set of principles for good writing, based on an understanding of how readers process information. Unlike such platitudes as \u201cBe clear\u201d or \u201cOmit needless words\u201d, our principles are constructive: one can easily check whether a piece of text satisfies them, and if it does not, the principles suggest concrete ways to improve it.",

      "Abstract": "This paper demonstrates translation schemes by which programs written in a functional subset of APL can be compiled to code that is run efficiently on general purpose graphical processing units (GPGPUs). Furthermore, the generated programs can be straightforwardly interoperated with mainstream programming environments, such as Python, for example for purposes of visualization and user interaction. Finally, empirical evaluation shows that the GPGPU translation achieves speedups up to hundreds of times faster than sequential C compiled code.",

      "Abstract": "We present an embedded language in Haskell for programming pipelined computations. The language is a combination of Feldspar (a functional language for array computations) and a new implementation of Ziria (a language for describing streaming computations originally designed for programming software defined radio). The resulting language makes heavy use of fusion: as in Feldspar, computations over arrays are fused to eliminate intermediate arrays, but Ziria processes can also be fused, eliminating the message passing between them, which in turn can give rise to more fusion at the Feldspar level. The result is a language in which we can first describe pipelined computations at a very fine-grained level, and only afterwards map computations onto the details of a specific parallel architecture, where the fusion helps us to generate efficient code. This flexible design method enables late design decisions cheaply, which in turn can lead to more efficient produced code. In the paper, we present two examples of pipelined computations in our language that can be run on Adapteva\u2019s Epiphany many-core coprocessor and on other back-ends.",

      "Abstract": "Parallel processing of big graph-shaped data still presents many challenges. Several approaches have appeared recently, and a strong trend focusing on understanding graph computation as iterative vertex-centric computations has emerged. There have been several systems in the vertex-centric approach, for example Pregel, Giraph, GraphLab and PowerGraph. Though programs developed in these systems run efficiently in parallel, writing vertex-programs usually results in code with poor readability, that is full of side effects and control statements unrelated to the algorithm.\nIn this paper we introduce \u201cs6raph\u201d, a new vertex-centric graph processing framework with a functional interface that allows the user to write clear and concise functions. The user can choose one of several default behaviours provided for most common graph algorithms. We discuss the design of the functional interface and introduce our prototype implementation in Erlang.",

      "Abstract": "Programming in HPC is a tedious work. Therefore functional programming languages that generate HPC programs have been proposed. However, they are not widely used by application scientists, because of learning barrier, and lack of demonstrated application performance.\nWe have designed Formura which adopts application-friendly features such as typed rational array indices. Formura users can describe mathematical concepts such as operation over derivative operators using functional programming. Formura allows intuitive expression over array elements while ensuring the program is a stencil computation, so that state-of-the-art stencil optimization techniques such as temporal blocking is always applied to Formura-generated program.\nWe demonstrate the usefulness of Formura by implementing a preliminary below-ground biology simulation. Optimized C-code are generated from 672 bytes of Formura program. The simulation was executed on the full nodes of the K computer, with 1.184 Pflops, 11.62% floating-point-instruction efficiency, and 31.26% memory throughput efficiency.",

      "Abstract": "Although now parallel computing is very common, current parallel programming methods tend to be domain-specific (specializing in certain program patterns such as nested loops) and/or manual (programmers need to specify independent tasks). This situation poses a serious difficulty in developing efficient parallel programs. We often need to manually transform codes written in usual programming patterns to ones in a parallelizable form. We hope to have a solid foundation to streamline this transformation. This talk first reviews necessity of a method of systematically deriving parallelizable codes and then introduces an ongoing work on extending lambda calculus for the purpose. The distinguished feature of the new calculus is a special construct that enable evaluation with incomplete information, which is useful to express important parallel computation patterns such as reductions (aggregations). We then investigate derivations of parallelizable codes as transformations on the calculus.",

Irregular parallel problems, where the number and size of tasks is unpredictable, are particularly challenging and require dynamic coordination.\nThe paper outlines a novel approach to delivering portable parallel performance for irregular parallel programs. The approach combines JIT compiler technology with dynamic scheduling and dynamic transformation of declarative parallelism.\nWe specify families of algorithmic skeletons plus equations for rewriting skeleton expressions. We present the design of a framework that unfolds skeletons into task graphs, dynamically schedules tasks, and dynamically rewrites skeletons, guided by a lightweight JIT trace-based cost model, to adapt the number and granularity of tasks for the architecture.\nWe outline the system architecture and prototype implementation in Racket/Pycket. As the current prototype does not yet automatically perform dynamic rewriting we present results based on manual offline rewriting, demonstrating that (i) the system scales to hundreds of cores given enough parallelism of suitable granularity, and (ii) the JIT trace cost model predicts granularity accurately enough to guide rewriting towards a good adaptive transformation.",

      "Abstract": "The paradigm of nested data parallelism (NDP) allows a variety of semi-regular computation tasks to be mapped onto SIMD-style hardware, including GPUs and vector units. However, some care is needed to keep down space consumption in situations where the available parallelism may vastly exceed the available computation resources. To allow for an accurate space-cost model in such cases, we have previously proposed the Streaming NESL language, a refinement of NESL with a high-level notion of streamable sequences.\nIn this paper, we report on experience with a prototype implementation of Streaming NESL on a 2-level parallel platform, namely a multicore system in which we also aggressively utilize vector instructions on each core. We show that for several examples of simple, but not trivially parallelizable, text-processing tasks, we obtain single-core performance on par with off-the-shelf GNU Coreutils code, and near-linear speedups for multiple cores.",

      "Abstract": "We present a Functional Compute Language (FCL) for low-level GPU programming. FCL is functional in style, which allows for easy composition of program fragments and thus easy prototyping and a high degree of code reuse. In contrast with projects such as Futhark, Accelerate, Harlan, Nessie and Delite, the intention is not to develop a language providing fully automatic optimizations, but instead to provide a platform that supports absolute control of the GPU computation and memory hierarchies. The developer is thus required to have an intimate knowledge of the target platform, as is also required when using CUDA/OpenCL directly.\nFCL is heavily inspired by Obsidian. However, instead of relying on a multi-staged meta-programming approach for kernel generation using Haskell as meta-language, FCL is completely selfcontained, and we intend it to be suitable as an intermediate language for data-parallel languages, including data-parallel parts of high-level array languages, such as R, Matlab, and APL.\nWe present a type-system and a dynamic semantics suitable for understanding the performance characteristics of both FCL and Obsidian-style programs. Our aim is that FCL will be useful as a platform for developing new parallel algorithms, as well as a targetlanguage for various code-generators targeting GPU hardware.",

      "Abstract": "Algebraic datatypes and pattern matching in Haskell lay a fertile ground to conveniently define and process abstract syntax trees (ASTs). However, in Haskell, trees often cannot grow: once a datatype is defined and compiled, it cannot be extended. Extensions to a datatype mainly appear as new fields to its existing data constructors, and/or new data constructors.\nAt the center of any metaprogramming system stand tall trees representing the abstract syntax of object terms. Metaprograms processing these trees often do so by decorating nodes with additional information. This additional information may appear as new fields to the existing data constructors, and/or new data constructors. Common practice is either post hoc, to define a new separate datatype representing the output decorated trees; or pre hoc, to use the same large datatype to represent both the non-decorated input and the decorated output trees. Both methods are often ad hoc; the former leads to duplication, and the latter forces the input trees to carry an unnecessary set of information making them inconvenient to work with.\nIn this talk, I introduce an encoding of datatypes that allows them to be extended in a post hoc manner, yet still argueably keeping them convenient to work with. It is done as a part of the the Summer of Haskell project titled \u201cNative Metaprogramming in Haskell\u201d, where we considered unifying the two most popular representations of Haskell\u2019s syntax: the small and convenient AST in the popular library Haskell-Src-Exts (HSE), and the large decorated AST used inside GHC\u2019s front-end (HsSyn).",

However, most package systems provide only a weak form of modularity, where packages depend directly on other packages. Backpack breaks new ground by arguing mixin packages can be a good fit for package-level modularity. Unfortunately, Backpack as was described in POPL\u201914 cannot be easily implemented for most existing languages today (including Haskell), because it tightly couples the compiler with the package manager. In this talk, I describe an evolution of the Backpack design which respects the division between package manager and compiler. This is not a paper design: it is principally motivated by our (ongoing) efforts to implement Backpack in GHC and the Cabal package system, which we hope to land for GHC 8.2.",

Joachim Breitner\u2019s Gipeda is a great diagnostic tool for analysing particular commits. In our effort to make GHC fast again, we were in need of diagnostic tools to analyze compound compile times across periods spanning from weeks to years.\nWith the Performance Indicator Tracking Application, Pita, we introduce a diagnostic tool for visualizing changes in GHC\u2019s performance characteristics over the course of development. Based on the same dataset used by Gipeda, Pita offers side-by-side comparisons across time and multiple tests. Using Pita, we are able to quickly identify correlations and patterns that trigger compile time speed bumps, allowing us to narrow down years of development to a small set of regressing commits.\nThis talk provides an introduction to Pita. Using hands-on examples we show how to chase down speed bumps in past commits. Finally, we discuss the state of our effort in improving GHC\u2019s performance, discussing some of the common themes that we have found in the course of the work and sharing some best practices for GHC contributors to minimize the impact of their changes on compiler performance.\nUsing Pita we have already reduced compiler allocations by 8% on average across nofib. We are hoping that with further work we will ultimately be able to bring compilation times back to pre-7.6 magnitudes in the coming year. We invite the community to help us realize this goal.",

      "Abstract": "Compilation with GHC was non-deterministic prior to version 8.0.2. Compiling with the same flags, sources, and environment could produce incompatible binary objects.\nNon-deterministic compilation causes several problems. Non-deterministic interface files result in slower incremental builds because of unnecessary recompilation. Distributed build systems, such as Buck or Bazel, cannot reliably cache non-deterministic object files, negating the primary benefit of distributed compilation. Non-determinism results in unstable symbol names, making code hot-swapping difficult. Non-deterministic output forces packagers of binary distributions such as Debian to waste resources recompiling after a trivial change and also makes it impossible to verify if a binary was built from the given code. \nDuring the past couple of months I tested GHC for non-determinism on itself and Stackage, developed a non-determinism test suite, and systematically audited GHC\u2019s internals to ensure that compilation is deterministic in GHC 8.0.2. In this talk I will discuss the causes of non-determinism, how I addressed them, and how we can keep GHC deterministic going forward.",

      "Abstract": "Haxl users at Facebook do a lot of development and testing inside GHCi. In fact, we\u2019ve built a customized version of GHCi that runs code in our Haxl monad by default instead of the IO monad, and has a handful of extra commands to support common workflows needed by our developers. This is a pretty smooth setup: right inside GHCi we can test the production code against real data, and interact with all of the services that our production systems talk to, while having a nice interactive edit/compile/test cycle.\nHowever, one thing is missed by many developers, especially those coming from other languages: easy access to a stack trace when debugging.\nThis talk will tell the story of how we implemented always-on stack traces in GHCi, which are now available in GHC 8.0.1. The implementation involves splitting out the interpreter from GHCi into a separate process, so that the interpreted code can run in profiling mode (where stack traces are available), while the compiler continues to run at full speed on the unprofiled runtime. GHC communicates with the interpreter using binary messages over a pipe.\nRemote GHCi has a number of other benefits, including fixing the long-standing annoyance that to compile TH code with -prof you had to build it twice. It will also be useful for using TH when cross-compiling, and has a lot of overlap with a similar mechanism already implemented in GHCJS; indeed we hope to converge on a single implementation in the future.\n(more background for the talk in this blog post: http://simonmar.github.io/posts/2016-02-12-Stack-traces-in-GHCi.html)",

      "Abstract": "New Haskell programmers often find themselves \u201ctrapped in a monad\u201d. Given a computation of type \u2018IO a\u2019, there is no way to get the \u2018a\u2019 value \u201cout\u201d of the computation. One can use the monadic \u2018bind\u2019 operator to create a new computation based on the old one, but this can lead to an awkward style of programming. Haskell is really two distinct sub languages, where the pure sub language is used to compose computations in the monadic sub-language. When effects need to be added to previously pure code we also need to undertake a big refactoring effort, converting \u2018let\u2019 to \u2018do\u2019, and \u2018map\u2019 to \u2018mapM\u2019 and so on.\nIn this talk I\u2019ll present a practical implementation of a coeffect system that lets us get the \u2018a\u2019 out. Given a suspended computation M of type \u2018IO a\u2019, \u2018run M\u2019 evaluates it, releasing its effect into the context, and producing the value of type \u2018a\u2019. Conversely, given a term N of type \u2018a\u2019 which would perform an IO effect when evaluated, \u2018box N\u2019 suspends its evaluation, returning a value of type \u2018IO a\u2019. This idea has been described previously, by both Filinski [1] who named the operators \u2018reflect\u2019 and \u2018reify\u2019, as well as Pfenning and Davies [2] in the context of lax modal logic.\nAlthough the theory works out, manually inserting \u2018run\u2019 and \u2018box\u2019 casts into a program is even more annoying than converting \u2018let\u2019-expressions to \u2018do\u2019-expressions when effects need to be added to pure code. Luckily, there is a way to automatically insert these casts during type checking, so we can write code in a style that assumes implicit effects (like in ML), but with types as nice as in Haskell. This system has recently been implemented in DDC [3] as an extension to Dunfield and Krishnaswami\u2019s bidirectional type checking algorithm [4]. Automatically inserting run and box casts works surprisingly well, and also supports DDC\u2019s approach to type safe freezing, where mutable objects can be converted to immutable ones, without unsafe hacks like \u2018unsafeFreezeArray\u2019.\n[1] Representing Monads Andrzej Filinski Principles of Programming Languages, 2004.\n[2] A Judgmental Reconstruction of Modal Logic Frank Pfenning and Rowan Davies Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, 2000.\n[3] The Disciplined Disciple Compiler https://github.com/DDCSF/ddc\n[4] Complete and Easy Bidirectional Typechecking for Higher-Ranked Polymorphism.

It also borrows interesting features from other languages, such as extensible records with row-type polymorphism and an intuitive YAML-like syntax.\nHaving a Haskell-inspired functional language certainly made it possible to build powerful abstractions. However, this often come at a price. Many of our prospective users in DevOps have little or no experience in functional programming. This means that they frequently have a hard time understanding how these languages work.\nThis is a problem for adoption: we want people to look at our examples and immediately feel at home.

      "Abstract": "The ML family of programming languages is best known as a family of functional programming languages, but most ML-family languages also offer support for effects such as control operators and state. Indeed, they usually support full first-class general references, which can contain values of any type, including higher types. Concretely, programmers may store functions that can modify the heap, within the heap itself.\nSince higher-order imperative programs are often much more difficult to understand than programs using either higher-order or imperative features alone, programmers are encouraged to stick to the functional fragment much as possible. However, one place where higher-order state is used quite heavily in practice is in interactive programs, like graphical user interfaces. These reactive systems are typically implemented in an aggressively higher-order stateful style, with each mutable component storing a set of callbacks to invoke whenever a particular event happens.\nIn this talk, I will describe a recent line of work on structuring these kinds of programs, based on the idea of using a Curry-Howard proof term correspondence with temporal logic as a type system for reactive programs. One of the surprises of this line of work is how many of the standard implementation techniques for reactive programs turn out to realize fundamental logical primitives. This opens the door to reactive programming models which retain both the simple reasoning principles of functional programming, and the efficient implementation strategies known to working programmers.",

      "Abstract": "Type classes are an immensely popular and productive feature of Haskell. They have since been adopted in, and adapted to, numerous other languages, including theorem provers. This talk will show that type classes have a natural and efficient representation in .NET. This paves the way for the extension of F# and other .NET languages with Haskell style type classes. The representation is type preserving and promises easy and safe cross-language inter-operation. We are currently, and rapidly, extending the open source C# compiler and language service, Roslyn, with support for type classes but intend to do the same for F# once that work has been completed.",

The key feature of our approach is polymorphic unification, which can be used to unify data structures of almost arbitrary types.

      "Abstract": "GNU Guix is a tool implementing the functional package management paradigm pioneered by Nix. It is rooted in the free software world where it has a growing user and contributor community. Guix and the Guix System Distribution (GuixSD) put an emphasis on providing a unified Scheme environment to deal with package management, container and virtual machine provisioning, operating system deployment, configuration, services, and associated activities.\nIn this talk I will describe the techniques we use to achieve this unified interface, with the intent to blur the user/developer distinction, and our early experience. The oft-discussed advantages of embedding domain-specific languages (DSLs) have allowed us to develop tools and a programming environment that many envy. Our use of Scheme covers domains traditionally associated with C, Perl, or Python: \u201cbuild scripts\u201d, system initialization code, service management, Linux containers, and more. Pervasive use of Scheme leads to a \u201cmulti-tier\u201d programming environment; I will describe our staging techniques, implemented as mere Scheme syntax extensions.",

      "Abstract": "F* is a language in the tradition of ML equipped with dependent types, monadic effects, refinement types and a weakest precondition calculus. Together, these features enable the F* programmer to prove functional correctness using a combination of automation via SMT solving and manual program proofs. \nIn the context of the greater Everest project, we are using F* to prove, build and deploy miTLS, a verified, efficient implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 protocol. \nThis extended abstract presents our work in progress. We are currently focusing our efforts on proving the memory safety and functional correctness of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) primitives, and on extracting this code to C. ECC primitives are a good candidate: they are modeled after the reference implementations in C. Therefore, they only exercise an imperative, first-order subset of F* that lends itself well to an efficient extraction to C.",

OCaml has been quietly forging ahead in the area with libraries like Mirage, whereby we can generate apps that operate at such a low level we don\u2019t even need operating systems on the backend anymore (removing 15 million lines of memory-unsafe code) - while at the same time, maintaining more reliable software with less effort through lightweight type-checked code sharing between server, browser clients, &amp; native mobile apps.\nWhile much theory and effort has been put into building the basis of Mirage, deploying unikernels into production (whether on public clouds or private servers) remains a very artisanal experience. In the talk we\u2019ll look at how the properties of Mirage unikernel enable us to rethink large sections of the app development lifecycle (apps that are MBs in size and boot in 50 milliseconds!), and also look at a case study of what it takes to move said unikernels to production with reliable testing, deployment, monitoring, and debug tooling.",

      "Abstract": "Niconico is a video sharing and a live streaming platform operated by Dwango. Dwango uses Scala widely for foundation systems such as an account system, a billing system and an event bus for inter-services. In this talk, we will introduce how to build web applications by using continuation monads. This approach is mainly used in the Niconico account system.\nThe Niconico account system has the following requirements: \n \n Various requests \n Various user registration leads \n OAuth logins (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) \n Multi-factor authentication \n Various responses \n HTML Pages (in Japanese, English and Chinese) \n JSON and XML \n Redirects \n Various filterings \n CSRF check \n Add CORS headers \n User tracking \n\nThe Niconico account system is developed with Play framework which is one of the most popular web framework in Scala. Play framework has component technologies for building web applications. But the composition functionality of Play framework is insufficient to our requirements. Therefore, we decided to use components of continuation monads instead of the standard technique of Play framework. We believe that our approach can also be applied to other languages, because a web framework often has similar nested structures such as Java Servlet, Python WSGI, and so on.\nThis talk will be a detailed explanation of the topic presented at ScalaMatsuri 2016.\nOur prototype implementation has been published on GitHub.",

      "Abstract": "Consider what it means to be a cache. You need to be able to (1) associate a key with a value and (2) get some value given a key if such a value exists. That\u2019s basically it. Caches tend to appear in layers. In a CPU, memory reads check L1, then L2, then L3, then RAM. When we want to load an image, we first check RAM, then disk, and finally network. \nIn a mobile app, if you don\u2019t nail your cache code, your users will suffer. Excessive networking causes both battery and data-plan drain. We can help ensure a clean correct implementation by combining caches. Given two caches A and B, A on-top-of B means first check A, fallthrough to B, then write back to A. Now we can define a monoid for caches. Monoids imply easy composition. Easy composition means reasoning about our code becomes easy.\nSuch an abstraction isn\u2019t possible to express both statically and generically in languages like Objective-C and Java, but we can with Swift\u2019s strong type system. The caching library Carlos provides the foundation upon which we can build prefetching and other useful transformations. In our app, adopting such a system simplified our codebase: Caches became reusable legos. But the complexity doesn\u2019t just all go away, it\u2019s just hidden. With an abstraction so nice, it\u2019s tempting to think of the actual caches and cache glue as black-boxes. One problem we ran into was a reference cycle that led to large bitmaps leaking and phones running out of memory. It\u2019s important to actually think about the implementation details in detail, since these are your building blocks for the rest of the system. When your building blocks are stable, your building is stable.\nCaching and prefetching are necessary for mobile apps. In this talk, I will explain how to think about caches as monoids, how a monoidal caching system can simplify our jobs as software engineers, and what real-world problems we ran into when putting such a system into production.",

      "Abstract": "What, in the end, distinguishes the functional programmer from the OO developer? Much effort is spent on arguing how FP is more efficient. More significant, however, is that functional programmers produce different models from their OO and relational counterparts, which enable more powerful software architecture. The talk traces this observation through 13 years of functional programming applied in industrial projects, in a variety of languages. I\u2019ll touch on projects in stage lighting (&quot;\u201cstage lighting has algebraic structure\u201d\u201c), financial derivatives (\u201d\u201cmarket data is compositional\u201d\u201c), semiconductor manufacturing (\u201d\u201chope is a monad\u201d\u201c, \u201d\u201cscheduling is an arrow\u201d\u201c), social pedagogy (\u201d\u201cthe GUI is a function\u201d&quot;), and others, as time permits.\nWhile a number of lessons from these experiences may seem obvious, they were hard-won: \n \n purely functional is better \n look for compositionality \n monads can be found in unexpected places \n\n(Not among them: Static types are better.)",

      "Abstract": "So, you\u2019ve written a DSL, it\u2019s a work of art! It so perfectly models the problem at hand that even a trained house cat could generate business value. You just have one problem, your interpreter runs 100x slower than a shell script launching JVMs in a loop.\nDomain specific languages (DSLs) are able to offer the abstraction benefits of a high-level language, while when compiled, competing with low-level languages on performance. Because DSLs have a much smaller problem area, many specialised optimisations can be performed which are not feasible for a general purpose language.\nIn this talk, we will explain a number of optimisations which are useful for DSLs, and show our solutions to the practical issues we faced when implementing them in our query language, Icicle.\nIcicle is a query language for processing large amounts of time-series data. Its type system enforces that queries require only a single pass over the data, and that multiple queries over the same data can be fused together. By using a combination of high level optimisations such as partial evaluation and common subexpression elimination, and low level optimisations such as parsing code which is specialised for the given input, our queries are faster than the equivalent hand-written C code.\nFrom this talk, the audience will learn how the focused point of view that DSLs provide can be useful in performance critical systems, as well as a number of concrete techniques for optimising their own DSLs.\nTarget\nAnyone who is interested in domain specific languages (DSLs), embedded or external, and wants to know how to make them beat the pants off hand written C/C++.\nThe techniques presented are applicable to DSLs written in any language, although a familiarity with Haskell syntax would be a plus.",

      "Abstract": "Most build systems start small and simple, but over time grow into hairy monstersthat few dare to touch. As we demonstrate in this paper, there are a few issuesthat cause build systems major scalability challenges, and many pervasivelyused build systems (e.g. Make) do not scale well. \nThis paper presents a solution to the challenges we identify. We use functionalprogramming to design abstractions for build systems, and implementthem on top of the Shake library, which allows us to describe build rules anddependencies. To substantiate our claims, we engineer a new build systemfor the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. The result is more scalable, faster, andspectacularly more maintainable than its Make-based predecessor.",

      "Abstract": "Fuzzing is a technique that involves testing programs using invalidor erroneous inputs. Most fuzzers require a set of valid inputs as astarting point, in which mutations are then introduced. QuickFuzz is afuzzer that leverages QuickCheck-style random test-case generationto automatically test programs that manipulate common file formatsby fuzzing. We rely on existing Haskell implementations offile-format-handling libraries found on Hackage, thecommunity-driven Haskell code repository. We have tried QuickFuzzin the wild and found that the approach is effective indiscovering vulnerabilities in real-world implementations of browsers,image processing utilities and file compressors among others.In addition, we introduce a mechanism to automatically derive random generators for the typesrepresenting these formats. QuickFuzz handles most well-known imageand media formats, and can be used to test programs and librarieswritten in any language.",

      "Abstract": "Software Transactional Memory (STM) has become very popular in Haskell. Currently, there are nearly 500 packages on Haskell's package archive that directly use STM\\@. Despite the widespread use in real world applications, Haskell's STM implementation has seen very few updates since its introduction in 2005. \nIn this work, we describe our efforts to redesign the STM implementation in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), based on a TL2-like implementation that is able to support both \\verb|orElse| and \\verb|retry| without the use of traditional nested transactions. We argue that our implementation is simpler than the current GHC implementation while supporting opacity. We also demonstrate that our implementation performs better than the current GHC implementation on a number of benchmarks by multiple orders of magnitude for long-running transactions. \nIn an effort to measure the performance of \\verb|orElse| and \\verb|retry|, we present an STM-based work stealing scheduler. With \\verb|orElse| and \\verb|retry|, we are able to elegantly implement the scheduler in just a few lines of code. We have modified the Par Monad, a real-world Haskell package that provides deterministic parallelism, to use our STM-based work stealing scheduler and show that it is not only simpler but is able to perform as well as the current scheduler.",

      "Abstract": "Using the theory of monoids and monoid actions, we give a unified framework that handles three common pointer manipulation tasks, namely, data serialisation, deserialisation, and memory allocation. Our main theoretical contribution is the formulation of the notion of a \\emph{twisted functor}, a generalisation of the semi-direct product construction for monoids. We show that semi-direct products and twisted functors are particularly well suited as an abstraction for many pointer manipulation tasks. \nWe describe the implementation of these abstractions in the context of a cryptographic library for Haskell. Twisted functors allow us to abstract all pointer arithmetic and size calculations into a few lines of code, significantly reducing the opportunities for buffer overflows.",

FitSpec tests mutant variations of functions under test against a given property set, recording any surviving mutants that pass all tests. The number of survivingmutants and any smallest survivor are presented to the user. A surviving mutant indicates incompleteness of the property set, prompting the user to amend a property or to add a new one, making the property set stronger. Based on the same test results, FitSpec also provides conjectures in the form of equivalences and implications between property subsets. These conjectures help the user to identify minimal core subsets of properties and so to reduce the cost of future property-based testing.",

      "Abstract": "Pattern matching has proven to be a convenient, expressive way of inspecting data. Yet this language feature, in its traditional form, is limited: patterns must be data constructors of concrete data types. No computation or abstraction is allowed. The data type in question must be concrete, with no ability to enforce any invariants. Any change in this data type requires all clients to update their code. \nThis paper introduces pattern synonyms, which allow programmers to abstract over patterns, painting over all the shortcomings listed above. Pattern synonyms are assigned types, enabling a compiler to check the validity of a synonym independent of its definition. These types are intricate; detailing how to assign a type to a pattern synonym is a key contribution of this work. We have implemented pattern synonyms in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, where they have enjoyed immediate popularity, but we believe this feature could easily be exported to other languages that support pattern matching.",

The ghc compiler for Haskell has optimizations to reduce those costs, but the optimizations are not sufficient. As a result, Haskell also provides a variety of strictness annotations so that users can indicate program points where an expression should be evaluated eagerly. Skillful use of those annotations is a black art, known only to expert Haskell programmers. In this paper, we introduce AUTOBAHN, a tool that uses genetic algorithms to automatically infer strictness annotations that improve program performance on representative inputs. Users examine the suggested annotations for soundness and can instruct AUTOBAHN to automatically produce modified sources. Experiments on 60 programs from the NoFib benchmark suite show that AUTOBAHN can infer annotation sets that improve runtime performance by a geometric mean of 8.5%. Case studies show AUTOBAHN can reduce the live size of a GC simulator by 99% and infer application-specific annotations for Aeson library code. A 10-fold cross-validation study shows the AUTOBAHN -optimized GC simulator generally outperforms a version optimized by an expert.",

When two keys are equal, we also obtain a concrete proof that their types are equal. This gives us a form of dynamic typing, without the need for Typeable constraints. We show that our extension allows us to safely do things we could not otherwise do: it allows us to implement the ST monad (inefficiently), to implement an embedded form of arrow notation, and to translate parametric HOAS to typed de Bruijn indices, among others. Although strongly related to the ST monad, the Key monad is simpler and might be easier to prove safe. We do not provide such a proof of the safety of the Key monad, but we note that, surprisingly, a full proof of the safety of the ST monad also remains elusive to this day. Hence, another reason for studying the Key monad is that a safety proof for it might be a stepping stone towards a safety proof of the ST monad.",

In this paper we introduce \\emph{supermonads}: an encoding of monadic notions that captures several different generalizations along with a version of the standard library of monadic functions that work uniformly with all of them.As standard Haskell type inference does not work for supermonads due to their generality, our supermonad implementation is accompanied with a language extension, in the form of a pluginfor the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), that allows type inferencefor supermonads, obviating the need for manual annotations.",

Two of the most important features supported by several existing extensions to CSL are higher-order quantification and custom ghost state. However, none of the logics that support both of these features reap the full potential of their combination. In particular, none of them provide general support for a feature we dub &quot;higher-order ghost state&quot;: the ability to store arbitrary higher-order separation-logic predicates in ghost variables. \nIn this paper, we propose higher-order ghost state as a interesting and useful extension to CSL, which we formalize in the framework of Jung et al.'s recently developed Iris logic. To justify its soundness, we develop a novel algebraic structure called CMRAs (&quot;cameras&quot;), which can be thought of as &quot;step-indexed partial commutative monoids&quot;. Finally, we show that Iris proofs utilizing higher-order ghost state can be effectively formalized in Coq, and discuss the challenges we faced in formalizing them.",

      "Abstract": "The polyvariance of a static analysis is the degree to which it structurally differentiates approximations of program values. Polyvariant techniques come in a number of different flavors that represent alternative heuristics for managing the trade-off an analysis strikes between precision and complexity. For example, call sensitivity supposes that values will tend to correlate with recent call sites, object sensitivity supposes that values will correlate with the allocation points of related objects, the Cartesian product algorithm supposes correlations between the values of arguments to the same function, and so forth. \nIn this paper, we describe a unified methodology for implementing and understanding polyvariance in a higher-order setting (i.e., for control-flow analyses). We do this by extending the method of abstracting abstract machines (AAM), a systematic approach to producing an abstract interpretation of abstract-machine semantics. AAM eliminates recursion within a language\u2019s semantics by passing around an explicit store, and thus places importance on the strategy an analysis uses for allocating abstract addresses within the abstract heap or store. We build on AAM by showing that the design space of possible abstract allocators exactly and uniquely corresponds to the design space of polyvariant strategies. This allows us to both unify and generalize polyvariance as tunings of a single function. Changes to the behavior of this function easily recapitulate classic styles of analysis and produce novel variations, combinations of techniques, and fundamentally new techniques.",

      "Abstract": "Analyzing real-world JavaScript web applications is a challenging task. On top of understanding the semantics of JavaScript, it requires modeling of web documents, platform objects, and interactions between them. Not only the JavaScript language itself but also its usage patterns are extremely dynamic. JavaScript can generate code and run it during evaluation, and most web applications load JavaScript code dynamically. Such dynamic characteristics of JavaScript web applications make pure static analysis approaches inapplicable.\nIn this talk, we present our attempts to analyze JavaScript web applications in the wild mostly statically using various approaches. From pure JavaScript programs to JavaScript web applications using platform-specific libraries and dynamic code loading, we explain technical challenges in analyzing each of them and how we built an open-source analysis framework for JavaScript, SAFE, that addresses the challenges incrementally.\nIn spite of active research accomplishments in analysis of JavaScript web applications, many issues still remain to be resolved such as events, callback functions, and hybrid web applications. We discuss possible future research directions and open challenges.\nSpeaker Bio\nSukyoung Ryu is an associate professor in the School of Computing at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).

      "Abstract": "Static type errors are a common stumbling block for newcomers to typed functional languages. We present a dynamic approach to explaining type errors by generating counterexample witness inputs that illustrate how an ill-typed program goes wrong. First, given an ill-typed function, we symbolically execute the body to synthesize witness values that make the program go wrong. We prove that our procedure synthesizes general witnesses in that if a witness is found, then for all inhabited input types, there exist values that can make the function go wrong. Second, we show how to extend the above procedure to produce a reduction graph that can be used to interactively visualize and debug witness executions. Third, we evaluate the coverage of our approach on two data sets comprising over 4,500 ill-typed student programs. Our technique is able to generate witnesses for 88% of the programs, and our reduction graph yields small counterexamples for 81% of the witnesses. Finally, we evaluate whether our witnesses help students understand and fix type errors, and find that students presented with our witnesses show a greater understanding of type errors than those presented with a standard error message.",

Yet, mechanization of Galois connections remains limited torestricted modes of use, preventing their general application in mechanizedmetatheory and certified programming. \nThis paper presents constructive Galois connections, a variant of Galoisconnections that is effective both on paper and in proof assistants; iscomplete with respect to a large subset of classical Galois connections; andenables more general reasoning principles, including the &quot;calculational&quot; styleadvocated by Cousot. \nTo design constructive Galois connection we identify a restricted mode of useof classical ones which is both general and amenable to mechanization independently-typed functional programming languages. Crucial to our metatheoryis the addition of monadic structure to Galois connections to control a&quot;specification effect&quot;. Effectful calculations may reason classically, whilepure calculations have extractable computational content. Explicitly movingbetween the worlds of specification and implementation is enabled by ourmetatheory. \nTo validate our approach, we provide two case studies in mechanizing existingproofs from the literature: one uses calculational abstract interpretation todesign a static analyzer, the other forms a semantic basis for gradual typing.Both mechanized proofs closely follow their original paper-and-pencilcounterparts, employ reasoning principles not captured by previousmechanization approaches, support the extraction of verified algorithms, andare novel.",

Our new compiler features a sequence of intermediate languages that allows it to incrementally compile away high-level features and enables verification at the right levels of semantic detail. In this way, it resembles mainstream (unverified) compilers for strict functional languages. The compiler supports efficient curried multi-argument functions, configurable data representations, exceptions that unwind the call stack, register allocation, and more. The compiler targets several architectures: x86-64, ARMv6, ARMv8, MIPS-64, and RISC-V. \nIn this paper, we present the overall structure of the compiler, including its 12 intermediate languages, and explain how everything fits together. We focus particularly on the interaction between the verification of the register allocator and the garbage collector, and memory representations.

      "Abstract": "Dependently typed languages such as Agda, Coq and Idris use a syntactic first-order unification algorithm to check definitions by dependent pattern matching. However, these algorithms don\u2019t adequately consider the types of the terms being unified, leading to various unintended results. As a consequence, they require ad hoc restrictions to preserve soundness, but this makes them very hard to prove correct, modify, or extend. \nThis paper proposes a framework for reasoning formally about unification in a dependently typed setting. In this framework, unification rules compute not just a unifier but also a corresponding correctness proof in the form of an equivalence between two sets of equations. By rephrasing the standard unification rules in a proof-relevant manner, they are guaranteed to preserve soundness of the theory. In addition, it enables us to safely add new rules that can exploit the dependencies between the types of equations. \nUsing our framework, we reimplemented the unification algorithm used by Agda. As a result, we were able to replace previous ad hoc restrictions with formally verified unification rules, fixing a number of bugs in the process. We are convinced this will also enable the addition of new and interesting unification rules in the future, without compromising soundness along the way.",

      "Abstract": "Increasing availability of multicore systems has led to greater focus on the design and implementation of languages for writing parallel programs. Such languages support various abstractions for parallelism, such as fork-join, async-finish, futures. While they may seem similar, these abstractions lead to different semantics, language design and implementation decisions, and can significantly impact the performance of end-user applications.\nIn this paper, we consider the question of whether it would be possible to unify various paradigms of parallel computing. To this end, we propose a calculus, called dag calculus, that can encode fork-join, async-finish, and futures, and possibly others. We describe dag calculus and its semantics, establish translations from the aforementioned paradigms into dag calculus. These translations establish that dag calculus is sufficiently powerful for encoding programs written in prevailing paradigms of parallelism. We present concurrent algorithms and data structures for realizing dag calculus on multicore hardware and prove that the proposed techniques are consistent with the semantics. Finally, we present an implementation of the calculus and evaluate it empirically by comparing its performance to highly optimized code from prior work. The results show that the calculus is expressive and that it competes well with, and sometimes outperforms, the state of the art.",

      "Abstract": "Session types provide static guarantees that concurrent programs respect communication protocols. We give a novel account of recursive session types in the context of GV, a small concurrent extension of the linear λ-calculus. We extend GV with recursive types and catamorphisms, following the initial algebra semantics of recursion, and show that doing so naturally gives rise to recursive session types. We show that this principled approach to recursion resolves long-standing problems in the treatment of duality for recursive session types. \nWe characterize the expressiveness of GV concurrency by giving a CPS translation to (non-concurrent) λ-calculus and proving that reduction in GV is simulated by full reduction in λ-calculus. This shows that GV remains terminating in the presence of positive recursive types, and that such arguments extend to other extensions of GV, such as polymorphism or non-linear types, by appeal to normalization results for sequential λ-calculi. We also show that GV remains deadlock free and deterministic in the presence of recursive types. \nFinally, we extend CP, a session-typed process calculus based on linear logic, with recursive types, and show that doing so preserves the connection between reduction in GV and cut elimination in CP.",

      "Abstract": "An important feature of functional programs is that they are parallel by default. Implementing an efficient parallel functional language, however, is a major challenge, in part because the high rate of allocation and freeing associated with functional programs requires an efficient and scalable memory manager. \nIn this paper, we present a technique for parallel memory management for strict functional languages with nested parallelism. At the highest level of abstraction, the approach consists of a technique to organize memory as a hierarchy of heaps, and an algorithm for performing automatic memory reclamation by taking advantage of a disentanglement property of parallel functional programs. More specifically, the idea is to assign to each parallel task its own heap in memory and organize the heaps in a hierarchy/tree that mirrors the hierarchy of tasks. \nWe present a nested-parallel calculus that specifies hierarchical heaps and prove in this calculus a disentanglement property, which prohibits a task from accessing objects allocated by another task that might execute in parallel. Leveraging the disentanglement property, we present a garbage collection technique that can operate on any subtree in the memory hierarchy concurrently as other tasks (and/or other collections) proceed in parallel. We prove the safety of this collector by formalizing it in the context of our parallel calculus. In addition, we describe how the proposed techniques can be implemented on modern shared-memory machines and present a prototype implementation as an extension to MLton, a high-performance compiler for the Standard ML language. Finally, we evaluate the performance of this implementation on a number of parallel benchmarks.",

      "Abstract": "Given an expression that denotes a probability distribution, often we want a corresponding density function, to use in probabilistic inference. Fortunately, the task of finding a density has been automated. It turns out that we can derive a compositional procedure for finding a density, by equational reasoning about integrals, starting with the mathematical specification of what a density is. Moreover, the density found can be run as an estimation algorithm, as well as simplified as an exact formula to improve the estimate.",

      "Abstract": "Dunfield showed that a simply typed core calculus with intersectiontypes and a merge operator is able to capture various programminglanguage features. While his calculus is type-safe, it is notcoherent: different derivations for the same expression canelaborate to expressions that evaluate to different values.The lack of coherence is an importantdisadvantage for adoption of his core calculus in implementations ofprogramming languages, as the semantics of the programming languagebecomes implementation-dependent. \nThis paper presents λi: a coherent and type-safe calculus with aform of *intersection types and a merge operator.Coherence is achieved by ensuring that intersection typesare disjoint and programs are sufficientlyannotated to avoid type ambiguity. We propose a definition of disjointness where twotypes A and B are disjoint only if certain set of types are commonsupertypes of A and B. We investigate three different variants of λi, with three variants of disjointness. In the simplestvariant, which does not allow top types, two types are disjoint ifthey do not share any common supertypes at all. The other two variantsintroduce top types and refine the notion of disjointness to allowtwo types to be disjoint when the only the set of common supertypes aretop-like. The difference between the two variants with toptypes is on the definition of top-like types, which has an impact onwhich types are allowed on intersections. We present a type systemthat prevents intersection types that are not disjoint, as well as analgorithmic specifications to determine whether two types are disjointfor all three variants.",

      "Abstract": "Effects and coeffects are two general, complementary aspects of program behaviour. They roughly correspond to computations which change the execution context (effects) versus computations which make demands on the context (coeffects). Effectful features include partiality, non-determinism, input-output, state, and exceptions. Coeffectful features include resource demands, variable access, notions of linearity, and data input requirements.The effectful or coeffectful behaviour of a program can be captured and described via type-based analyses, with fine grained information provided by monoidal effect annotations and semiring coeffects. Various recent work has proposed models for such typed calculi in terms of graded (strong) monads for effects and graded (monoidal) comonads for coeffects.Effects and coeffects have been studied separately so far, but in practice many computations are both effectful and coeffectful, e.g., possibly throwing exceptions but with resource requirements. To remedy this, we introduce a new general calculus with a combined effect-coeffect system. This can describe both the changes and requirements that a program has on its context, as well as interactions between these effectful and coeffectful features of computation. The effect-coeffect system has a denotational model in terms of effect-graded monads and coeffect-graded comonads where interaction is expressed via the novel concept of graded distributive laws. This graded semantics unifies the syntactic type theory with the denotational model. We show that our calculus can be instantiated to describe in a natural way various different kinds of interaction between a program and its evaluation context.",

      "Abstract": "Dependent type theories are functional programming languages with types rich enough to do computer-checked mathematics and software verification. Homotopy type theory is a recent area of work that connects dependent type theory to the mathematical disciplines of homotopy theory and higher-dimensional category theory. From a programming point of view, these connections have revealed that all types in dependent type theory support a certain generic program that had not previously been exploited. Specifically, each type can be equipped with computationally relevant witnesses of equality of elements of that type, and all types support a generic program that transports elements along these equalities. One mechanism for equipping types with non-trivial witnesses of equality is Voevodsky\u2019s univalence axiom, which implies that equality of types themselves is witnessed by type isomorphism. Another is higher inductive types, an extended datatype schema that allows identifications between different datatype constructors. While these new mechanisms were originally formulated as axiomatic extensions of type theory, recent work has investigated their computational meaning, leading to the development of new programming languages that better support them. In this talk, I will illustrate what univalence and higher inductive types mean in programming terms. I will also discuss how studying some related semantic settings can reveal additional structure on types; for example, moving from groupoids (categories where all maps are invertible) to general categories yields an account of coercions instead of equalities. Overall, I hope to convey some of the beauty and richness of these connections between disciplines, which we are just beginning to understand.\nSpeaker Bio\nDan Licata is an assistant professor of computer science at Wesleyan University.

      "Abstract": "Many programming languages and proof assistants are defined by elaboration from a high-level language with a great deal of implicit information to a highly explicit core language. In many advanced languages, these elaboration facilities contain powerful tools for program construction, but these tools are rarely designed to be repurposed by users. We describe elaborator reflection, a paradigm for metaprogramming in which the elaboration machinery is made directly available to metaprograms, as well as a concrete realization of elaborator reflection in Idris, a functional language with full dependent types. We demonstrate the applicability of Idris's reflected elaboration framework to a number of realistic problems, we discuss the motivation for the specific features of its design, and we explore the broader meaning of elaborator reflection as it can relate to other languages.",

      "Abstract": "We consider the problem of how to compactly encode simply-typed λ-terms into bit strings. The work has been motivated byKobayashi et al.'s recent work on higher-order data compression, where data are encoded as functional programs (or, λ-terms) that generate them. To exploit its good compression power,the compression scheme has to come with a method for compactly encodingthe λ-terms into bit strings. To this end, we propose two type-based bit-encoding schemes; the first one encodes a λ-term into a sequence of symbols by using type information, and then applies arithmetic coding to convert the sequence to a bit string. The second one is more sophisticated; we prepare a context-free grammar (CFG) that describes only well-typed terms, and then use a variation of arithmetic coding specialized for the CFG.We have implemented both schemes and confirmed that they oftenoutput more compact codes than previous bit encoding schemes for λ-terms.",

      "Abstract": "We propose an automated method for disproving fair termination of higher-order functional programs, which is complementary to Murase et al.'s recent method for proving fair termination. A program is said to be fair terminating if it has no infinite execution trace that satisfies a given fairness constraint. Fair termination is an important property because program verification problems for arbitrary ω-regular temporal properties can be transformed to those of fair termination. Our method reduces the problem of disproving fair termination to higher-order model checking by using predicate abstraction and CEGAR. Given a program, we convert it to an abstract program that generates an approximation of the (possibly infinite) execution traces of the original program, so that the original program has a fair infinite execution trace if the tree generated by the abstract program satisfies a certain property. The method is a non-trivial extension of Kuwahara et al.'s method for disproving plain termination.",

This yields an awkwardformalization and results in a type system whose behaviour is in somecases unintuitive and/or unduly restrictive. \nIn this work, we present an alternative formalization of polymorphicvariants, based on set-theoretic types and subtyping, that yieldsa cleaner and more streamlined system. Our formalization is moreexpressive than the current one (it types more programs while preservingtype safety), it can internalize some meta-theoretic properties, and itremoves some pathological cases of the current implementation resultingin a more intuitive and, thus, predictable type system.More generally, this work shows how to add full-fledged union types tofunctional languages of the ML family that usually rely on theHindley-Milner type system. As an aside, our system also improvesthe theory of semantic subtyping, notably by proving completeness forthe type reconstruction algorithm.",

      "Abstract": "Full-spectrum dependent types promise to enable the development of correct-by-construction software. However, even certified software needs to interact with simply-typed or untyped programs, be it to perform system calls, or to use legacy libraries. Trading static guarantees for runtime checks, the dependent interoperability framework providesa mechanism by which simply-typed values can safely be coerced to dependent types and, conversely, dependently-typed programs can defensively be exported to a simply-typed application. In this paper, we give a semantic account of dependent interoperability. Our presentation relies on and is guided by a pervading notion of type equivalence, whose importance has been emphasized in recent work on homotopy type theory. Specifically, we develop the notion of partial type equivalences as a key foundation for dependent interoperability. Our framework is developed in Coq; it is thus constructive and verified in the strictest sense of the terms. Using our library, users can specify domain-specific partial equivalences between data structures. Our library then takes care of the (sometimes, heavy) lifting that leads to interoperable programs. It thus becomes possible, as we shall illustrate, to internalize and hand-tune the extraction of dependently-typed programs to interoperable OCaml programs within Coq itself.",

      "Abstract": "We present a framework aimed at significantly reducing the cost of verifying certain classes of systems software, such as file systems. Our framework allows for equational reasoning about systems code written in our new language, Cogent. Cogent is a restricted, polymorphic, higher-order, and purely functional language with linear types and without the need for a trusted runtime or garbage collector. Linear types allow us to assign two semantics to the language: one imperative, suitable for efficient C code generation; and one functional, suitable for equational reasoning and verification. As Cogent is a restricted language, it is designed to easily interoperate with existing C functions and to connect to existing C verification frameworks. Our framework is based on certifying compilation: For a well-typed Cogent program, our compiler produces C code, a high-level shallow embedding of its semantics in Isabelle/HOL, and a proof that the C code correctly refines this embedding. Thus one can reason about the full semantics of real-world systems code productively and equationally, while retaining the interoperability and leanness of C. The compiler certificate is a series of language-level proofs and per-program translation validation phases, combined into one coherent top-level theorem in Isabelle/HOL.",

      "Abstract": "This paper documents our experience of adapting and using the QuickCheck-style approach for extensive randomised property-based testing of computational geometry algorithms. \nThe need in rigorous evaluation of computational geometry procedures has naturally arisen in our quest of organising a medium-size programming contest for second year university students\u2014an experiment we conducted as an attempt to introduce them to computational geometry. The main effort in organising the event was implementation of a solid infrastructure for testing and ranking solutions. For this, we employed functional programming techniques. The choice of the language and the paradigm made it possible for us to engineer, from scratch and in a very short period of time, a series of robust geometric primitives and algorithms, as well as implement a scalable framework for their randomised testing. \nWe describe the main insights, enabling efficient random testing of geometric procedures, and report on our experience of using the testing framework, which helped us to detect and fix a number of issues not just in our programming artefacts, but also in the published algorithms we had implemented.",

While software engineers appreciate contracts as tools for articulating the interface between components, functional programmers desperately search for their types and meaning, completely forgetting about their pragmatics. \nThis gem presents a novel analysis of contract systems. Applied to the higher-order kind, this analysis reveals their large and clearly unappreciated software engineering potential. Three sample applications illustrate where this kind of exploration may lead.",

      "Abstract": "The increasing importance of parallelism has motivated the creation of better abstractions for writing parallel software, including structured parallelism using nested algorithmic skeletons. Such approaches provide high-level abstractions that avoid common problems, such as race conditions, and often allow strong cost models to be defined. However, choosing a combination of algorithmic skeletons that yields good parallel speedups for a program on some specific parallel architecture remains a difficult task. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to simultaneously reason both about the costs of different parallel structures and about the semantic equivalences between them. This paper presents a new type-based mechanism that enables strong static reasoning about these properties. We exploit well-known properties of a very general recursion pattern, hylomorphisms, and give a denotational semantics for structured parallel processes in terms of these hylomorphisms. Using our approach, it is possible to determine formally whether it is possible to introduce a desired parallel structure into a program without altering its functional behaviour, and also to choose a version of that parallel structure that minimises some given cost model.",

      "Abstract": "A fully abstract compiler guarantees that two source components are observationally equivalent in the source language if and only if their translations are observationally equivalent in the target. Full abstraction implies the translation is secure: target-language attackers can make no more observations of a compiled component than a source-language attacker interacting with the original source component. Proving full abstraction for realistic compilers is challenging because realistic target languages contain features (such as control effects) unavailable in the source, while proofs of full abstraction require showing that every target context to which a compiled component may be linked can be back-translated to a behaviorally equivalent source context.\nWe prove the first full abstraction result for a translation whose target language contains exceptions, but the source does not. Our translation\u2014specifically, closure conversion of simply typed λ-calculus with recursive types\u2014uses types at the target level to ensure that a compiled component is never linked with attackers that have more distinguishing power than source-level attackers. We present a new back-translation technique based on a shallow embedding of the target language into the source language at a dynamic type. Then boundaries are inserted that mediate terms between the untyped embedding and the strongly-typed source. This technique allows back-translating non-terminating programs, target features that are untypeable in the source, and well-bracketed effects.",

We get to the bottom of necessary properties of the sorting algorithms and predicates in play as well as discuss variations of the modelled non-determinism.On top of that, we formulate and prove a theorem stating that no matter which sorting function we use, the corresponding permutationfunction enumerates all permutations of the input list. We use free theorems, which are derived from the type of a functionalone, to prove the statement.",

      "Abstract": "Incremental computation aims to speed up re-runs of a program afterits inputs have been modified slightly. It works by recording a traceof the program's first run and propagating changes through the tracein incremental runs, trying to re-use as much of the original trace aspossible. The recent work CostIt is a type and effect system toestablish the time complexity of incremental runs of a program, as afunction of input changes. However, CostIt is limited in twoways. First, it prohibits input changes that influence controlflow. This makes it impossible to type programs that, for instance,branch on inputs that may change. Second, the soundness of CostItis proved relative to an abstract cost semantics, but it is unclearhow the semantics can be realized. \nIn this paper, we address both these limitations. We present DuCostIt,a re-design of CostIt, that combines reasoning about costs ofchange propagation and costs of from-scratch evaluation. The latterlifts the restriction on control flow changes. To obtain the typesystem, we refine Flow Caml, a type system for information flowanalysis, with cost effects. Additionally, we inherit from CostItindex refinements to track data structure sizes and a co-monadictype. Using a combination of binary and unary step-indexed logicalrelations, we prove DuCostIt's cost analysis sound relative to notonly an abstract cost semantics, but also a concrete semantics, whichis obtained by translation to an ML-like language.",

      "Abstract": "TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. Its computational model is based on dataflow graphs with mutable state. Graph nodes may be mapped to different machines in a cluster, and within each machine to CPUs, GPUs, and other devices. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, but it particularly targets training and inference with deep neural networks. It serves as a platform for research and for deploying machine learning systems across many areas, such as speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, and natural language processing.\nIn this talk, we describe TensorFlow and outline some of its applications. We also discuss the question of what TensorFlow and deep learning may have to do with functional programming. Although TensorFlow is not purely functional, many of its uses are concerned with optimizing functions (during training), then with applying those functions (during inference). These functions are defined as compositions of simple primitives (as is common in functional programming), with internal data representations that are learned rather than manually designed.\nTensorFlow is joint work with many other people in the Google Brain team and elsewhere.

Our first contribution is to adapt the classic operational semantics oλ-calculus to a continuous setting via creating a measure space on terms and defining step-indexed approximations. We prove equivalence of big-step and small-step formulations of this distribution-based semantics. To move closer to inference techniques, we also define the sampling-based semantics of a term as a function from a trace of random samples to a value. We show that the distribution induced by integration over the space of traces equals the distribution-based semantics. Our second contribution is to formalize the implementation technique of trace Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for our calculus and to show its correctness. A key step is defining sufficient conditions for the distribution induced by trace MCMC to converge to the distribution-based semantics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous correctness proof for trace MCMC for a higher-order functional language, or for a language with soft constraints.",

In this paper we investigate the dual idea: indexed codata types, which allow us to describe data-dependencies about infinite data structures. Unlike finite data which is defined by constructors, we define infinite data by observations. Dual to pattern matching on indexed data which may refine the type indices, we define copattern matching on indexed codata where type indices guard observations we can make. \nOur key technical contributions are three-fold: first, we extend Levy's call-by-push value language with support for indexed (co)data and deep (co)pattern matching; second, we provide a clean foundation for dependent (co)pattern matching using equality constraints; third, we describe a small-step semantics using a continuation-based abstract machine, define coverage for indexed (co)patterns, and prove type safety. This is an important step towards building a foundation where (co)data type definitions and dependent types can coexist.",

Once such properties are encoded in a datatype, however, all code manipulating that datatype must provide proof that it maintains these properties in order to typecheck. In this paper, we take a step towards gradualizing these obligations. We introduce a tool, Ghostbuster, that produces simplified versions of GADTs which elide selected type parameters, thereby weakening the guarantees of the simplified datatype in exchange for reducing the obligations necessary to manipulate it. Like ornaments, these simplified datatypes preserve the recursive structure of the original, but unlike ornaments we focus on information-preserving bidirectional transformations. Ghostbuster generates type-safe conversion functions between the original and simplified datatypes, which we prove are the identity function when composed. We evaluate a prototype tool for Haskell against thousands of GADTs found on the Hackage package database, generating simpler Haskell'98 datatypes and round-trip conversion functions between the two.",

We propose a functional approach tovertex-centric graph processing in which the computation at everyvertex is abstracted as a higher-order function and present Fregel, anew domain-specific language. Fregel has clear functional semantics,supports declarative description of vertex computation, and can beautomatically translated into Pregel, an emerging imperative-styledistributed graph processing framework, and thereby achieve promisingperformance. Experimental results for several typical examples showthe promise of this functional approach.",

He co-founded Galois in 2000, a technology transfer company that used language technologies to create trustworthiness in critical systems. In 2008 he returned to academia and research, joining the University of Kansas and the Information and Telecommunication Technology Center.\nAndy believes that functional languages like Haskell are a great medium for expressing algorithms and solving problems. Since returning to academia, he has targeted the application areas of telemetry and signal processing, specializing in generating high performance circuits from specifications. His research interests include optimization, language design, debugging, and dependability. The long-term goal of his research is to offer engineers and practitioners the opportunity to write clear and high-level executable specifications that can realistically be compiled into efficient implementations.",

I think we have failed. Languages that provide strong guarantees are bemoaned as too complicated, compilers ignore those high-level guarantees anyway, and the folklore persists that C is the only language useful for writing fast code.\nI want to make programs easier to design, write, and understand. To that end, I work on verifying compilers. I am particularly interested in equivalence preserving (fully-abstract) compilers. I also dabble in dependent types and compiler design and implementation.",

After two years in industry, he spent seven years as a lecturer at University College London, and nine years as a professor at Glasgow University, before moving to Microsoft Research (Cambridge) in 1998. His main research interest is in functional programming languages, their implementation, and their application. He has led a succession of research projects focused around the design and implementation of production-quality functional-language systems for both uniprocessors and parallel machines. He was a key contributor to the design of the now-standard functional language Haskell, and is the lead designer of the widely-used Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). He has written two textbooks about the implementation of functional languages.\nMore generally, he is interested in language design, rich type systems, software component architectures, compiler technology, code generation, runtime systems, virtual machines, and garbage collection. He is particularly motivated by direct use of principled theory to practical language design and implementation \u2013 that\u2019s one reason he loves functional programming so much.",

The basic idea is to allow one to represent probability distributions as \u201crandom\u201d programs. Such programs are the most expressive possible probabilistic formalism, and could surely be the basis of a good tool if one could put a good inference engine behind them. I\u2019ve worked out a reasonable interface to doing inference in discrete-only probability spaces this way, and published a prototype of it that does inference with depth-first search, and am now trying to figure out how to implement a machine that can track dependencies in its computations to do backtracking more intelligently.",

Previously, she was a Principal Member of the Technical Staff at AT&amp;T Labs Research, a Consulting Faculty Member in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, and a program manager at DARPA where she started and managed the HACMS and PPAML programs. Kathleen\u2019s research focuses on advancing the theory and practice of programming languages and on applying ideas from the programming language community to the problem of ad hoc data management. The main thrust of her work has been in domain-specific languages to facilitate programming with massive amounts of ad hoc data, including the Hancock system for efficiently building signatures from massive transaction streams and the PADS system for managing ad hoc data. Recently, she has been exploring synergies between machine learning and programming languages and studying how to apply advances in programming languages to the problem of building more secure systems.\nKathleen is an ACM Fellow. She has served as program chair for FOOL, ICFP, CUFP, and OOPSLA and as General Chair for ICFP 2015. Kathleen is past Chair of the ACM Special Interest Group in Programming Languages (SIGPLAN), past Co-Chair of CRA\u2019s Committee on the Status of Women (CRA-W), and a former editor of the Journal of Functional Programming. She is an Associate Editor for TOPLAS.",

Before starting at MIT, he was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard. His research focuses on applications of formal logic to software development and analysis. One specialty area is building machine-checked mathematical proofs of correctness for programming tools like compilers and runtime systems, and he has a general interest in the pragmatics of machine-checked mathematics. He also works in the design and implementation of functional programming languages, as in the example of his new domain-specific programming language Ur/Web, which brings strong mathematical guarantees to the world of Web applications.",

Over the years, he worked on topics related to programming languages, their design, use, and implementation. With Noble and Potter, he proposed the notion of flexible alias control which became know as Ownership Types. He led the Ovm project which produced the first real-time Java virtual machine to be flight tested on a ScanEagle drone (he claims no one was harmed). Outcomes of this project include the Schism real-time garbage collector and the FijiVM \u2013 a production VM for embedded systems. More recently, he worked on dynamic languages, trying to make sense of JavaScript and to design a new language called, Thorn. Nowadays, he spends his time with statisticians and data scientists. Jan believes that his 2012 election as Chair of SIGPLAN was an accident; since has been busy trying to rock the boat to ensure this does not happen again. In his spare time, Jan enjoys organizing conferences and sitting on PCs (over 25 in the last decade). He founded the MOS (mobile objects), IWACO (alias control), STOP (gradual typing), and TRANSACT (transactional memory) workshop series. He was the first program chair of VEE and chaired ESOP, ECOOP, Coordination and TOOLS. He was the general chair of PLDI (in Beijing!), ISMM and LCTES. He may still be sitting on the steering committees of ECOOP, JTRES, ICFP, OOPLSA, POPL, PLDI, LCTES, ESOP.",

When Java came out, he started to add functional programming constructs to the new platform. This led to Pizza and GJ and eventually to Java 5 with generics. During that time he also developed javac, the current reference compiler for Java. \nOver the last 10 years, Martin worked on unifying object-oriented and functional programming in the Scala language. Scala quickly escaped from the research lab and became a popular open source tool and industrial language. He now oversees development of Scala as head of the programming group at EPFL and as chairman of the Typesafe company.",

      "Abstract": "We proudly announce the SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop at ICFP. The purpose of this mentoring workshop is to encourage senior undergraduate and beginning graduate students to pursue careers in programming language research. We are specifically interested in attracting groups who have traditionally not had the opportunity to participate in research in functional programming. This workshop will be a combination of learning about the work being done in several areas of programming language research and mentoring with respect to helping students prepare for graduate school and the rest of their career. We will bring together leaders in programming language research from academia and industry to give talks on the kind of research typically performed after obtaining a Ph.D. The workshop will engage students, specifically interested in programming language research, in a process of imagining how they might contribute to the world.\nWorkshop Focus\nOur effort is inspired by and modeled on the highly successful mentoring workshop associated with the POPL conference (PLMW). This workshop has occurred yearly since 2012; we\u2019d like to bring this opportunity to the functional programming community. Our focus for this workshop will be early career graduate students. In particular, we will design the program for the benefit of students entering their first or second year of graduate school. Undergraduates who are seriously considering an academic career will also benefit from the workshop.\nApplications (Due July 1st)\nTo apply for support to come to PLMW and ICFP, please login to hotcrp. Note that hotcrp is not designed precisely for scholarship applications: \n \n please click \u201cstart new submission\u201d. \n please put \u201ctitle\u201d into the \u201ctitle\u201d field and list yourself as the only \u201cauthor\u201d. \n please fill out the rest of the fields as they appear in the form. \n\nFollow this link: https://plmw-icfp16.hotcrp.com/ to begin the application process. You do not need to complete the application in a single sitting; please complete it at your leisure, but finish by July 1st.\nPlease email the organizers if you have any questions.",

      "Abstract": "We proudly announce the SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop at ICFP. The purpose of this mentoring workshop is to encourage senior undergraduate and beginning graduate students to pursue careers in programming language research. We are specifically interested in attracting groups who have traditionally not had the opportunity to participate in research in functional programming. This workshop will be a combination of learning about the work being done in several areas of programming language research and mentoring with respect to helping students prepare for graduate school and the rest of their career. We will bring together leaders in programming language research from academia and industry to give talks on the kind of research typically performed after obtaining a Ph.D. The workshop will engage students, specifically interested in programming language research, in a process of imagining how they might contribute to the world.\nWorkshop Focus\nOur effort is inspired by and modeled on the highly successful mentoring workshop associated with the POPL conference (PLMW). This workshop has occurred yearly since 2012; we\u2019d like to bring this opportunity to the functional programming community. Our focus for this workshop will be early career graduate students. In particular, we will design the program for the benefit of students entering their first or second year of graduate school. Undergraduates who are seriously considering an academic career will also benefit from the workshop.\nApplications (Due July 1st)\nTo apply for support to come to PLMW and ICFP, please login to hotcrp.

It will be informal, consisting of invited talks, contributed talks on work in progress, and open-ended discussion sessions. \nGoals of the Workshop\nA recurring theme in many papers at ICFP, and in the research of many ICFP attendees, is the interaction of higher-order programming with various kinds of effects: storage effects, I/O, control effects, concurrency, etc. While effects are of critical importance in many applications, they also make it hard to build, maintain, and reason about one\u2019s code. Higher-order languages (both functional and object-oriented) provide a variety of abstraction mechanisms to help \u201ctame\u201d or \u201cencapsulate\u201d effects (e.g. monads, ADTs, ownership types, typestate, first-class events, transactions, Hoare Type Theory, session types, substructural and region-based type systems), and a number of different semantic models and verification technologies have been developed in order to codify and exploit the benefits of this encapsulation (e.g. bisimulations, step-indexed Kripke logical relations, higher-order separation logic, game semantics, various modal logics). But there remain many open problems, and the field is highly active.\nThe goal of the HOPE workshop is to bring researchers from a variety of different backgrounds and perspectives together to exchange new and exciting ideas concerning the design, semantics, implementation, and verification of higher-order effectful programs.\nWe want HOPE to be as informal and interactive as possible.

With the addition of handlers they have become an exciting new programming construct for implementing such effects. Languages such as Eff have demonstrated that handlers can be used as a more composable alternative to monads for implementing effects in a pure language.\nOCaml provides many standard effects, such as mutable state, built into the language. Those effects not built into the language, for example concurrency, are traditionally implemented using monads. The first part of this talk will describe work to implement native algebraic effects for OCaml. The original motivation for this work was to provide built-in support for concurrency in OCaml without tying the language to a particular concurrency implementation. However, algebraic effects support many interesting examples beyond concurrency.\nAs with exceptions, algebraic effects risk being performed in a context where they will not be handled. Type systems designed to track the side-effects of expressions have been around for many years, and seem eminently suitable for ensuring all algebraic effects are appropriately handled. Recent developments in languages such as Koka have begun to produce effect systems that are genuinely usable, but they have yet to breakthrough into a more mainstream language. The second part of this talk will describe work to integrate an effect system into OCaml whilst maintaining backwards compatibility. This system both prevents effects from going unhandled and turns OCaml into a pure functional language: successfully tracking the purity of functions through their types.\nThe talk will discuss the interesting questions and challenges that still remain before this work is ready for release into OCaml.\nThis is joint work with Stephen Dolan, Matija Pretnar and KC Sivaramakrishnan.",

It will be informal, consisting of invited talks, contributed talks on work in progress, and open-ended discussion sessions. \nGoals of the Workshop\nA recurring theme in many papers at ICFP, and in the research of many ICFP attendees, is the interaction of higher-order programming with various kinds of effects: storage effects, I/O, control effects, concurrency, etc. While effects are of critical importance in many applications, they also make it hard to build, maintain, and reason about one\u2019s code. Higher-order languages (both functional and object-oriented) provide a variety of abstraction mechanisms to help \u201ctame\u201d or \u201cencapsulate\u201d effects (e.g. monads, ADTs, ownership types, typestate, first-class events, transactions, Hoare Type Theory, session types, substructural and region-based type systems), and a number of different semantic models and verification technologies have been developed in order to codify and exploit the benefits of this encapsulation (e.g. bisimulations, step-indexed Kripke logical relations, higher-order separation logic, game semantics, various modal logics). But there remain many open problems, and the field is highly active.\nThe goal of the HOPE workshop is to bring researchers from a variety of different backgrounds and perspectives together to exchange new and exciting ideas concerning the design, semantics, implementation, and verification of higher-order effectful programs.\nWe want HOPE to be as informal and interactive as possible.

With the addition of handlers they have become an exciting new programming construct for implementing such effects. Languages such as Eff have demonstrated that handlers can be used as a more composable alternative to monads for implementing effects in a pure language.\nOCaml provides many standard effects, such as mutable state, built into the language. Those effects not built into the language, for example concurrency, are traditionally implemented using monads. The first part of this talk will describe work to implement native algebraic effects for OCaml. The original motivation for this work was to provide built-in support for concurrency in OCaml without tying the language to a particular concurrency implementation. However, algebraic effects support many interesting examples beyond concurrency.\nAs with exceptions, algebraic effects risk being performed in a context where they will not be handled. Type systems designed to track the side-effects of expressions have been around for many years, and seem eminently suitable for ensuring all algebraic effects are appropriately handled. Recent developments in languages such as Koka have begun to produce effect systems that are genuinely usable, but they have yet to breakthrough into a more mainstream language.

All ML languages share several fundamental traits, besides a good deal of syntax. They are higher-order, strict, mostly pure, and typed, with algebraic and other data types. Their type systems are derived from Hindley-Milner. The development of these languages has inspired a significant body of computer science research and influenced the design of many other programming languages, including Haskell, Scala and Clojure, Rust, ATS and many others.\nML workshops have been held in affiliation with ICFP continuously since 2005. This workshop specifically aims to recognise the entire extended ML family and to provide a forum for presenting and discussing common issues, both practical (compilation techniques, implementations of concurrency and parallelism, programming for the Web) and theoretical (fancy types, module systems, metaprogramming). The scope of the workshop includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory, application, implementation, and teaching of the members of the ML family. We also encourage presentations from related languages (such as Scala, Rust, Nemerle, ATS, etc.), to exchange experience of further developing ML ideas.\nThe ML family workshop will be held in close coordination with the OCaml Users and Developers Workshop.",

This includes both traditional large-scale scientific computing (HPC), as well as work targeting single node systems with SMPs, GPUs, FPGAs, or embedded processors. FHPC 2016 seeks to encourage a range of submissions, focussing on work in progress and facilitating early exchange of ideas and open discussion on innovative and/or emerging results. Experience reports are also welcome.\nMore information at the external website: FHPC 2016",
