      "Abstract": "The original idea of using pattern languages for design knowledge was proposed by the architect Christopher Alexander in the 1970s. The book he wrote with his colleagues comprises 253 patterns on practical architectural design. Ten years after the book was published, in the late 1980s, Alexander\u2019s idea of a pattern language was adopted in the field of software design by K. Beck and W. Cunningham, followed by the famous book \u201cDesign Patterns\u201d by E. Gamma, et al. Since the 1990s, the fields in which pattern languages have been applied has greatly expanded, encompassing education, innovation, collaboration, and other professional areas and activity in everyday life, which we term these as \u201cPattern Language 3.0\u201d. The challenge for pattern languages is finding ways to share knowledge and how to involve people into the collaborating design process. In this talk, I will give an overview of the history and frontiers of pattern languages, including examples in new domains, creating processes, and new ways for expressing pattern languages.\nBio\nTakashi Iba is an associate professor in the Faculty of Policy Management at Keio University. He received a Ph.D. in Media and Governance from Keio University. He is the president of CreativeShift Lab, Inc. and a board member of The Hillside Group. Collaborating with his students, Dr. Iba created many pattern languages concerning human actions like Learning Patterns (2014), Presentation Patterns (2014), Collaboration Patterns (2014), Words for a Journey (2015), Project Design Patterns (2016) and also academic books in Japanese such as the bestselling Introduction to Complex Systems (1998).",

      "Abstract": "We present a rationale for expanding the presence of the Lisp family of programming languages in bioinformatics and computational biology research. Put simply, Lisp-family languages enable programmers to more quickly write programs that run faster than in other languages. Languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure facilitate the creation of powerful and flexible software that is required for complex and rapidly evolving domains like biology. We will point out several important key features that distinguish languages of the Lisp family from other programming languages, and we will explain how these features can aid researchers in becoming more productive and creating better code. We will also show how these features make these languages ideal tools for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. We will specifically stress the advantages of domain-specific languages (DSLs): languages that are specialized to a particular area, and thus not only facilitate easier research problem formulation, but also aid in the establishment of standards and best programming practices as applied to the specific research field at hand. DSLs are particularly easy to build in Common Lisp, the most comprehensive Lisp dialect, which is commonly referred to as the \u2018programmable programming language\u2019. We are convinced that Lisp grants programmers unprecedented power to build increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems that may ultimately transform machine learning and artificial intelligence research in bioinformatics and computational biology.",

      "Abstract": "Data persistence can add a great deal of complexity to application software, and making the gap between application and storage has been a constant field of research, experiments and products. In the object oriented programming paradigm, persistence seems to be a natural extension to object behavior, and even though one could argue that many persistent object systems have flaws and leak their abstractions, there is a large body of prior art and research in that area.\nIn the functional programming world, persistence does not find as natural a partnering abstraction, and it is often either conceptionally pushed to the boundaries of the application, or treated in an ad-hoc fashion interleaved with the beauty and conceptional rigor of pure functions.\nThe presentation discusses these forces and explores how Clojure\u2019s Software Transactional Memory system can be used to implement application data persistence.",

      "Abstract": "Business applications are usually data-intensive. The process of designing and implementing such applications benefits from working with realistic data to sharpen requirements and discover pitfalls. However, such data is usually quite extensive and the feedback cycles during programming and design activities can become long and distracting. As a result, programmers might prefer abstract thinking and mental simulations over working with concrete, realistic data. We propose a new approach supporting live programming, with immediate feedback and explorable runtime data, for the domain of data-intensive business applications on top of relational databases. With the integration of streamed access to sampled data, we can employ productive traits of a live programming environment such as Squeak/Smalltalk, which is not optimized for the processing of huge amounts of data and is hence not well-suited for such tasks. We describe two representative scenarios and also discuss limitations by putting our approach in relation to the current development of business applications.",

      "Abstract": "Modern hardware is increasingly becoming heterogeneous to help improve the efficiency of our software and systems.&nbsp;Processors incorporating cores with diverse performance and power characteristics are already found in mobile devices. Software running on such processors can choose between a high performing but power hungry core or a slow core with lower power consumption. Individual cores can further be clocked at different frequencies. This shift towards heterogeneity is not limited to processors alone. The challenge to scale DRAM beyond 20 nm led scientists to look for new memory technologies. Of the known alternatives, phase change memory is the most promising. But owing to certain drawbacks, of which higher latency and limited lifetime are the most prominent, recent research proposes using a combination of DRAM and PCM, also called hybrid memory, to best fulfill the memory requirements of future applications.&nbsp;On the software side, developers today increasingly prefer managed languages for improved productivity. Managed workloads are ubiquitous, yet, prior work in making the best use of heterogeneous hardware through scheduling on different core types, performance prediction for frequency scaling, and dynamic memory management for systems with hybrid memory almost entirely assumes native applications written in C and C++. In this talk, I will discuss new opportunities for improving the performance and efficiency of managed language applications running on heterogeneous hardware. I will first introduce a new performance predictor for multithreaded managed applications that enables accurately estimating the execution time of a managed application at a different frequency setting. I will then discuss the challenge of scheduling concurrent garbage collection, a critical component of all managed runtimes, on a heterogeneous multicore. Our proposed scheduler dynamically adjusts the amount of time the collector threads spend on the high performing versus the slow core leading to improved efficiency and better performance compared to existing proposals. Finally, I will briefly share early results and our experiences with building a new garbage collector for systems with hybrid memory that mitigates a major drawback of PCM i.e., limited lifetime of individual cells, while also improving energy efficiency. In all three case studies, I will show how making the language runtime aware of the underlying hardware leads to a higher reduction in energy consumption without sacrificing too much performance.",

      "Abstract": "Learning how to design and implement a program is hard. Most text books on programming describe each topic in terms of syntax followed by some examples. Little or no attention is paid to how to design a program systematically. Where design is treated, it is often accommodated in a separate course. As a consequence, Integration of these types of knowledge and skills often does not happen.\nFor the development of concurrent programs, we have developed a systematic design method in which the development process is divided into a sequence of explicit, manageable steps. The procedure is intended to scaffold student\u2019s learning of concurrency concepts and their application as part of a first year university course in object-oriented programming. The procedure imparts conceptual knowledge and scaffolds students on how to analyze, design and implement a concurrent program step-by-step. Each steps comprise (standard) OO structuring, decisions to take, and reflection on both the design and implementation process. The systematic method, helps students to develop better software, to understand difficult concepts and to integrate conceptual and procedural knowledge. Moreover, students learn to think systematically before act.",

      "Abstract": "Interactive debuggers are indispensable in many software development scenarios. However, they are often hard to extend and more importantly, their capabilities are limited to an Application Programming Interface (API) provided by the runtime executing the corresponding programming language.\nWe propose an approach that allows to use the live tools of a Smalltalk environment for other programming languages. The approach is based on interpreter-level composition, ultimately making a full-fledged Integrated Development Environment (IDE) part of the language execution process. This allows to directly control interpreters of foreign languages from Smalltalk. It also enables tool reuse and provides the ability to rapidly build new tools.\nAs an example, we demonstrate how we have combined Squeak/Smalltalk and PyPy\u2019s Python implementation. We then reused Squeak\u2019s debugger, so that it enables edit-and-continue style debugging of Python applications \u2014 something that is currently not supported by Python\u2019s PDB or any Python IDE.",

In order to immediately connect those mental images with the data objects created by the program, we propose a live programming environment, called Kanon, specialized for data structure programming. It automatically executes a program being edited, and draws objects and their mutual references as a node-link diagram. In order to visualize information relevant to the programmer\u2019s concern, it offers two visualization modes based on the cursor position in the editor. It also offers two interactive mechanisms that relate elements in the program to elements on the diagram, and vice versa. The implementation includes a novel technique for mental map preservation of visual diagrams.",

      "Abstract": "Programmers write source code that compiles to programs, and users execute the programs to benefit from their features. While issue-tracking systems help communication between these two groups of people, feature requests have usually been written in text with optional figures that follows community guidelines and needs human interpretation to understand what to implement in which part of the source code. To make this process more direct, intuitive, and efficient, a streamlined interaction design called \u201cUser- Generated Variables (UGV)\u201d is proposed. First, the users can declare parameters that they want to tweak in existing programs without reading or understanding the source code. Then, the system turns the proposal into variable declarations in the relevant part of the source code. Finally, the programmers are notified of the proposal and can implement the actual features to reflect changes in the variable value. The proposed interaction is implemented in two existing Web-based Integrated Development Environments, and its user experience is briefly tested with eight users and programmers. Its technical requirements, limitations, and potentials are discussed. The content of this paper with live demo will be available at http://junkato.jp/ugv.",

      "Abstract": "Smart systems are characterised by their ability to analyse measured data in live and to react to changes according to expert rules. Therefore, such systems exploit appropriate data models together with actions triggered by domain-related conditions. Often thousands of updates need to be processed in a short amount of time, to detect which rules need to be triggered. The challenge at hand is that smart systems usually run on restricted hardware, like Raspberry Pi. There have been several approaches investigated to efficiently check conditions on data models, such as OCL-Gremlin or EMF-IncQuery. However, these solutions assume either that rules and data models fit into main memory or rely on high latency persistence storages, which severely damage the reactivity of smart systems. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel composition process, which weaves executable rules into a data model with lazy loading abilities. Our approach targets models@run.time usages and has been evaluated on a real-world home automation case study. We quantitatively show that our approach can handle, at low latency, big sets of rules on top of large-scale data models, even on restricted hardware.",

Domain-Specific (Modeling) Languages (DSLs) aim at bridging the gap between the problem and solution spaces. They are usually small and intuitive software languages whose concepts and expressiveness are focused on a particular domain. As software languages are software too, the development of DSLs and their supporting environment (editors, generators, simulators, etc.) inherits the complexity of software development in general. Techniques for increasing reuse from one DSL to another and supporting the customization of legacy ones to meet new requirements may improve the quality of DSLs and allow DSLs to be created more quickly and and cheaply. Consequently, the benefits in terms of productivity when using DSL technologies may more easily offset the initial investment required in developing such DSLs.

Existing modelling representations lack a comprehensive set of security building blocks or lack support for composition or refinement of the design under consideration. We propose a new modular meta-model for representing these security designs. This model supports both composition for more complex solutions and representing different levels of abstraction to model the underlying details. This meta-model can subsequently be used for the construction of security solutions, supporting a wide range of mechanisms on a wide variety of abstraction levels, thereby providing a foundation for the security-by-design approach.",

      "Abstract": "After two decades of research on superimpositions, aspects, and complex event notations, I suggest several basic principles for specifying and formally verifying modules using such cross-cutting notations. These principles can also be applicable for emerging applications and new modularization constructs. \nFirst, it is essential to find a clean semantic definition for the construct, e.g., viewing aspects as a system transformer. This leads to the need for specification as the relation between \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d applying the construct. Specifications need also to carefully include the context in order to be verifiable. Verification needs to be done for generic contexts, in advance of use in applications, and must deal with interferences among such complex modules. Finally, existing automatic tools and results from formal methods can and should be adapted to new modularity constructs.\nAfter illustrating these ideas for aspects and complex events, I show their relevance for additional domains. As one example, autonomous systems, such as lunar rovers, need to be self-stabilizing under arbitrary faults (e.g., when cosmic rays corrupt small but key parts of computer memory). Such faults can throw the system to an otherwise \u201cimpossible\u201d state, and a self-stabilizing module needs to then return the system to normal operation without unnecessarily disturbing parts of the system that still are functioning correctly. Other examples include augmenting systems to analyze and optimize power consumption, and modeling internet or cloud security with several modules that simulate attacks, detect an ongoing attack, and/or prevent incursions or disruptions of service.\nBio\nShmuel Katz is an Emeritus Professor in the Computer Science Department at the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology.

      "Abstract": "Program analyses are an important tool to check if a system fulfills its specification. A typical implementation strategy for program analyses is to use an imperative, general-purpose language like Java, and access the program to be analyzed through libraries that offer an API for reading, writing and manipulating intermediate code, such as BCEL or ASM for Java bytecode. We claim that this hampers reuse and interoperability. In this paper we propose a complete ECore-metamodel for Java bytecode, which can be used as a common basis for arbitrary program analyses. We provide tools to generate instances of our bytecode metamodel from Java code in class file format to and vice versa. Code analyses as well as instrumentations can then be defined as model transformations in a declarative, domain-specific language. As a consequence, the implementation of program analysis becomes more concise, more readable and more modular. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by two case studies: profiling of timing performance and model checking of reachability requirements.",

      "Abstract": "Software is becoming increasingly large, complex and critical to our society. Modularity is a key principle to manage its growing size and complexity. The purpose of this talk is to provide some insights into todays and upcoming challenges and possible solutions for software modularity at the programming language level. To achieve this, we will look at the patterns and lessons learned from the past, in particular 25+ years of research on modularity and software composition at the University of Twente. We will also address current and upcoming modularity challenges in the state of the practice of the software industry. \nTo illustrate the issues, we will look at examples from large scale embedded systems, and energy management in particular: such systems typically bring high technical complexity, caused by a complex problem domain and strong technical requirements. This requires the composition of many different concerns, with substantial long-term benefits for modular software.\nLooking back in time, we will discuss the \u2018inheritance anomalies\u2019 by Matsuoka et.al., which provided a first structured look into the challenges of composing functional and synchronisation concerns in objects. This led to a generalized model for describing issues in the composition and reuse of multiple concerns. Over time, new composition challenges appeared, such as crosscutting concerns over multiple objects and composing the behavior of message interactions. We will particularly focus on examples of software engineering challenges that are posed by typical (embedded) optimization problems, such as energy conservation policies. \nFinally, we will look into a number of modularization challenges, mostly from the perspective of the state-of-the practice in large-scale industrial software development: what innovations have been adopted and have made a significant change, what trends have impact on modularization issues, and what is needed to make sure better, more modular software is actually created in practice? \nBio\nLodewijk Bergmans is a consultant at the Software Improvement Group, where he helps clients in understanding and addressing their software problems regarding quality, architecture and best practices, taking the business context, risks and costs into account.

      "Abstract": "Separation of Concerns is an important aid to understand and construct large software systems. The concept of a Separation of Concerns Space (SoC Space) separates concerns from components and thereby, provides indices to structure component spaces, aids decomposition and composition.\nThe talk presents the concept, shows that it generalizes feature modeling, hybrid automata, context-oriented programming and other so far unrelated programming paradigms. We also define several general laws on SoC spaces that have a profound consequences for modularity and reuse. Since a SoC space provides indices to the component space, it offers techniques of index-based decomposition and composition. SoC Spaces form a new, specific and abstract form of composition system naturally supporting the principle of separation of concerns for a wide range of applications.\nBio\nUwe A&szlig;mann holds the Chair of Software Engineering at the Technische Universit&auml;t Dresden.

      "Abstract": "Software driving and using the Cloud (and the web) often count among the largest software systems ever produced and executed. It is therefore of paramount importance to dispose of appropriate structuring mechanisms, notably for their modular construction, execution and evolution. However, due to new constraints on how such systems must scale, new technologies (such as broker-less interacting Clouds, NoSQL databases), and new application domains and requirements (such as stream-oriented business analytics, end-to-end security), popular traditional modularization mechanisms are not sufficient for Cloud programming.\nIn this talk I first present an analysis of which characteristics and trends in Cloud architectures and programming are relevant for the modularization of Cloud infrastructures and applications. This analysis is then complemented by a survey of new means for the modularization of Cloud software.\nBio\nMario S&uuml;dholt is a full professor in Computer Science at IMT Atlantique, Nantes, France.

I will start by presenting core concepts of REScala, a language for concurrent and distributed reactive programming. Next, I will focus on our ongoing work on CorrL, a core language that aims at unifying concepts for reactives, events, and streams to enable a broad range of custom correlation behaviors, be it relational-algebra joins, CEP-style event patterns, RP combinators, or synchronization patterns. The key insight is to separate general-purpose and custom correlation semantics via an extensible effect system that enables fine-grained control over correlation semantics, which resembles the way aspects enable control over the semantics of a base language. I will conclude with a more speculative discussion of how I envision CorrL\u2019s concepts to be integrated into REScala and its generalized correlation semantics to be part of a module system for reactive cloud-based applications.\nBio\nMira Mezini is professor of computer science and vice-president for research and innovation at Technische Universit&auml;t Darmstadt, Germany.

      "Abstract": "In software development, we must always be ready to respond to changes. To reflect changes flexibly, code should be organized according to system usage. Making code modularization fully reflect system usage may seem to be too ambitious. Fortunately, tests capture system usage in a well readable form of examples. However, relating a change to the corresponding place in code remains difficult because code is organized according to technical concerns, such as objects. In this paper, we propose test driven modularization, which aims at organizing code according to tests and enforces tests to be represented in code. For this, use case modularization is adapted to accommodate expressing tests in code. Test driven modularization remains compatible with use case modularization while at the same time opens new capabilities of having different views on software based on use cases and various tests simultaneously. The results of measuring effort to comprehend user actions in user interface of scenarios and complexity of use case modules show that employing user acceptance tests in code improves code comprehension and maintenance. Also, test driven modularization reduces switching between tests and code in test driven development.",

      "Abstract": "In this talk I will first review existing units of reuse and techniques for separation of concerns, and explain how programming / modelling language features, in particular interfaces and composition operators, affect the capability of creating units that are both reusable and generic. I will then present the vision of Concern-oriented Reuse (CORE), a novel reuse approach that extends Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) with best practices from advanced modularization and separation of concerns techniques, goal modelling, and Software Product Lines (SPL). CORE advocates the use of a three-part interface to describe a new unit of reuse called concern that spans multiple development phases. The variation interface describes the available functional- and implementation alternatives that the concern encapsulates, and the impact of choosing one over another on system qualities. The customization interface allows adapting a chosen variation to a specific reuse context, while the usage interface defines how a customized concern may eventually be used. I will also elaborate on the support for delayed decision making in CORE, which makes it possible to build reusable concerns on top of other reusable concerns without restricting the lower-level genericity and variability unnecessarily.\nThroughout the talk I will illustrate the ideas of CORE on practical examples presented with our software design modelling tool TouchCORE.\nBio\nJ&ouml;rg Kienzle is an associate professor at the School of Computer Science at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, where he is leading the Software Engineering Laboratory.

      "Abstract": "Modularity has been addressed at various levels in the software development life cycle including programming, design and architecture. Several abstractions and guidelines have been proposed to ensure a modularly composable system that is needed for different quality factors such as adaptability, reuse and maintainability. \nWhereas traditionally software systems were addressing a single domain, we can now observe the composition of multiple systems that are integrated in a coherent way, leading to software-intensive system-of-systems (SoSs). In parallel we observe the need for the right allocation of concerns over the different system entities and the composition of the systems. In this talk I will discuss the notion of modularity from the perspective of system-of-systems.

Adapting such programs at runtime is an extreme solution given the delicate live contexts the debugging activity takes place.

Dimensions of Dynamic Layers activation are reified to allow very fine definitions of layer scopes and a fine grained selection of adapted entities.

      "Abstract": "In future smart computing environments, e.g., smart home, smart mobility, smart grid or pervasive health, autonomously designed subsystems are dynamically interconnected to smart service systems to develop their full potential. Other than existing approaches from the domain of Self-organizing Software Systems, where the application structure emerges from internal constraints or mechanisms, smart service systems require complex application models and a coordinating instance for their setup. In this paper, we utilize role-based application models, by means of a collaboration specification, for automated, on-demand service composition in decentralized infrastructures, i.e., infrastructures without a predefined central coordinator. We propose a two-phase development methodology in which a collaboration designer specifies the overall collaboration including its abstract functionality and several (other) developers complement it with its concrete performance. We verify our approach using a case study which rigorously follows the proposed development methodology and demonstrate that role-based application models provide sufficient information to guide the discovery and composition process for smart service systems.",

The context-sensitive and live-adaptive are important features for next-generation systems such as IoT and Industrial 4.0. Context-Oriented Programming (COP) Languages give us adequate modularity to implement those features. However, even if we construct a program on COP, we cannot predict enough for its behavior. We consider a thinking way of Operating Systems (OS) would be help-ful to overcome this problem. In OS, researchers have proposed communication algorithms based on some common problems, such as the five philosophers\u2019 prob-lem. Towards finding typical problems of COP such as the five philosophers\u2019 problem, we propose a simple cooperative robot system simulator. The novel mecha-nism of this system is that the one and same COP pro-gram drive a cooperative robot on both a virtual map and real worlds. We expect the mechanism contributes to imagine realistic issues of context-oriented software for constructing next generation robots.

The mechanism performs checkpoints before each adaptation and employs specialized sensors to detect bugs resulting from recent configuration changes. When the runtime detects a bug, it assumes that the bug belongs to the latest configuration. The runtime rolls back to the recent checkpoint to recover and subsequently notifies the developer to fix the bug and re-applying the adaptation through unanticipated adaptation. We prototype the concept as part of our role-based runtime engine LyRT and demonstrate the applicability of the rollback recovery mechanism for unanticipated adaptation in erroneous situations.",

      "Abstract": "With ubiquitous computing, autonomous cars, and cyber- physical systems (CPS), adaptive software becomes more and more important as computing is increasingly context- dependent. Role-based programming has been proposed to enable adaptive software design without the problem of scat- tering the context-dependent code. Adaptation is achieved by letting objects play roles during runtime. With every role, the object\u2019s behavior is modified to adapt to the given context. In recent years many role-based programming lan- guages have been developed. While they greatly differ in the set of supported features, they all incur in large runtime over- heads resulting in inferior performance. The increased vari- ability and expressiveness of the programming languages have a direct impact on the run-time and memory consump- tion. In this paper we provide a detailed analysis of state- of-the-art role-based programming languages, with empha- sis on performance bottlenecks. We also provide insight on how to overcome these problems via language re-design.",

      "Abstract": "Responsive Web Design (RWD) enables web applications to adapt to the characteristics of different devices such as screen size which is important for mobile browsing. Today, the only W3C standard to support this adaptability is CSS media queries. However, using media queries it is impossible to create applications in a modular way, because responsive elements then always depend on the global context. Hence, responsive elements can only be reused if the global context is exactly the same. This makes it extremely challenging to develop large responsive applications, because the lack of true modularity makes certain requirement changes either impossible or expensive to realize. \nIn this paper we extend RWD to also include responsive modules, i.e., modules that adapt their design based on their local context, independently of the global context. We present the ELQ project which implements our approach. ELQ is a novel implementation of so-called element queries which generalize CSS media queries. Importantly, our design conforms to existing web specifications, enabling adoption on a large scale. ELQ is designed to be heavily extensible using plugins. Experimental results show speed-ups of the core algorithms of up to 37x compared to previous approaches.",

      "Abstract": "Abstract\nA paradigm shift is taking place on the Web. Users spend less and less time using browsers and more and more time using instant messaging applications. While originally designed to facilitate communication among humans, these platforms now position themselves as \u201cnext-generation browsers\u201d to interact with services and businesses. They do this by offering the ability to extend their platforms with chatbots: applications that interact with the user through chat.\nThis shift toward a dialoge-based mode of interaction will have a profound impact on the programming technologies that will be needed to effectively develop applications for the Conversational Web. While existing Web technology will continue to play an important role, new frameworks are emerging that facilitate dialogue-based interactions. There is also a growing need to extend explicitly programmed scripts with AI toolkits to bridge the gap between ambiguous humans and rigid APIs. We will discuss these trends, review today\u2019s state-of-the-art bot SDKs and AI toolkits, and highlight new opportunities where programming abstractions and program analyses can help developers in this rapidly evolving domain.\nBio\nTom Van Cutsem leads a research team at Nokia Bell Labs in Antwerp, Belgium.

      "Abstract": "Immediate mode UI programming is based on continually drawing the UI in a render loop, handling events in between frames using ordinary control-flow. This supports straightforward understanding and debugging of UI code, without inversion of control. In this paper I present TwoStones, a simple DSL for immediate mode Web UI programming in a purely functional style: it presumes a single, immutable application model which is updated functionally through the use of cursors (a kind of zipper). Relying only on immutable data means that time-travel debugging and undo-facilities are easy to implement. For exposition purposes, the semantics of TwoStones is first decomposed in two parts: one semantics for rendering, and one semantics for event handling. Finally, they are merged again for better performance. A number of examples show the potential of the approach.",

      "Abstract": "A recent trend in application development for the web is a move towards rich internet applications (RIAs). As more and more of the application logic is moved to the client, these applications can benefit from concurrency in order to increase overall performance as well as responsiveness of the application. Additionally, RIAs are often written in an event-driven style of programming to react to incoming events of a multitude of services that are integrated within the application.\nIn this paper we argue that, while individual technologies exist to tackle both concerns, these technologies cannot easily be integrated in an ad hoc way. In order to increase the modularisability and composability of RIAs we propose a new programming model based on actors and reactors that encapsulate different parts of the application. We show that our model is able to exploit some of the available concurrency while reducing the required amount of event-driven code. Both actors and reactors are modular components that can be glued together via a unified communication mechanism. We evaluate our approach by means of a motivating example of a collaborative code editor.",

      "Abstract": "Web applications are inherently event-driven and traditionally implemented using imperative callbacks in Javascript. An alternative approach for such programs is functional reactive programming (FRP). FRP offers abstractions to make event-driven programming convenient, safe and composable, but like pure functions it is isolated from the `outside\u2019 world. In this paper we describe our experience in developing a library that binds FRP to the document object model (DOM). We describe that in its current state there are fundamental issues that do not yet have a perfect solution. We expand upon the functionality of existing FRP DOM libraries with an FRP model for DOM properties. We show that despite of some design problems a pragmatic library can be created that can be used to create web applications.",

When developers have to inspect past states of programs in order to solve them, they often have to restart the applications to be able to analyze the states live instead of inspecting them retrospectively. Omniscient debugging offers back-in-time debugging capabilities by recording full runs of applications, at the cost of scalability.\nIn this work we present an in-between approach called back-in-time evaluation that extends online debuggers with back-in-time capabilities. Instead of tracing full runs, the lifetime of the stored events are reduced to the scope of the methods they are executed in, which incurs a runtime overhead of only a few percent.",

      "Abstract": "A common problem arising from embedding a virtual machine as a component in a larger software system is the management of references between the VM\u2019s managed heap and the embedder\u2019s heap. Direct references between components allow fast communication, but can result in cycles over component boundaries, making these hybrid systems prone to memory leaks. In this paper we present a design and implementation of a tracing mechanism for effective and efficient garbage collection over component boundaries which is implemented and shipped in Chrome\u2019s JavaScript virtual machine V8 and the Blink rendering engine. Tracing through the C++ heap of Blink poses several challenges on which we elaborate: 1) an abstract visitation mechanism for C++ objects that can be used by the V8 garbage collector, 2) write barriers for C++ objects to reduce pauses through incremental marking, and 3) a mechanism to verify correctness of write barrier usage.",

      "Abstract": "Debuggers in interactive programming environments are powerful tools to explore and develop systems at runtime.\nHowever, among users of scripting languages such as Python or Ruby, a debugger is sometimes viewed as a rarely used \u201cdevelopment time\u201d tool. As Seaton, Van De Vanter, and Haupt have observed debugging support is assumed to come with compromises: there surely must be a performance impact; in order to minimize the impact when debugging is not needed the functionality surely must be limited; the complexity of debugging couples debuggers closely to just one language; and in order to actually use debugging facilities, one surely must accept the inconvenience of having to run the program in a special \u201cdebug\u201d mode.\nDue to the inconvenience involved in using debuggers in such systems, developers instead set up feedback loops by creating the infrastructure for quick, repeated test executions. This further cements the distinction between \u201cdevelopment time\u201d and \u201cdeployment time\u201d: to a program running in production, this feedback loop infrastructure is not available and any issues have to be reproduced and distilled into tests on a development system before they can be fixed.\nAs Gilad Bracha has noted, this separation of development time and deployment time stands in contrast to environments in the Lisp, Smalltalk, and Self heritage that view programs as live, continuously evolving systems. The development environment is the runtime environment and developers can work with concrete objects and can interrupt, inspect, and modify runtime state, and keep running.\nIn this work, we present a prototype virtual machine (VM) written in RPython based on the RSqueak/VM that provides Squeak/Smalltalk\u2019s live development and debugging to PyPy Python and Topaz Ruby. Of particular interest in this context is how the interpreters can be adapted in a general fashion for Smalltalk-style development, as well as the practical overhead of such an integration.\nThe core features of our prototype are: \n \n A combination of multiple RPython interpreters in the same, cooperatively scheduled execution environment, \n Smalltalk-style unhandled exception debugging for Ruby and Python, \n Smalltalk-style edit-and-continue for Ruby and Python.",

In spite of this, no modern-day language has emerged which leverages this property of implicit parallelism. As a first step towards the creation of such a language, we introduce a virtual machine design which is based on the tagged-token dataflow model. Notably, this design offers the fundamental concepts of the underlying model as first-class entities, which makes it possible to support various high-level language features without the need for any additional runtime support.",

However, programming these devices is too complex for most users and the existing standards for GPU programming are available only for low-level languages such as C.\nDynamic programming languages offer higher abstractions and functionality for many users. GPU programming is possible for dynamic languages through external libraries or via wrappers in which the GPU code is normally written in C. Either way, programmers have to rely on third-party libraries with a limited number of operations or program the GPU kernels themselves.\nIn this work we present a technique to automatically offload parts of the input program written in a dynamic language into OpenCL without any changes in the original source code. Our preliminary results show we achieve speedups of up to 150x when using the GPU.",

More, in order to make interoperability straighforward, OCaml-Java provides an extension to the original OCaml type system that allows the developer to manipulate Java instances directly from OCaml programs.\nIn this talk we will present the current state of the project, and the ongoing effort to improve performance and usability.",

Whilst much theory and practice argues in favour of insulation (the creation of architectural boundaries prohibiting the leakage of information) we will find that many successful systems take a diametrically opposed approach. We name this family of systems as those based on externalised state transfer. Rather than hiding implementation details behind APIs, object interfaces or similar, these systems actively advertise their internal structure and its coordinates via data and metadata. Examples of these systems include RESTful web applications, MIDI devices, and the DWARF debugging file format. We discuss such systems and how we can purposefully design new systems embodying such virtues in a more distilled form.",

For instance, the solution of a differential equation may help us understand the natural world, the value of a parameter of a statistical model may help us understand the probabilistic structure of a domain, the variable assignment maximising an objective function may help to further business goals. A secondary class of knowl- edge discovery stems from the act of using a programming language. By modeling a domain computationally, the developer can discover new and interesting properties of that domain, and better convey those insights to others. The purpose of this work is twofold: First, we want to show that programming languages can help their users achieve knowledge discovery moments and, secondly, that this property is the least exploited feature of programming languages in the general science community. We want to outline a research program with the objective of making scientific programming more efficient in its ultimate goal of knowledge discovery.",

Have we already completely explored the software engineering noosphere with respect to errors and reliability? \nIn this paper, I discuss an novel concept, called ``software antifragility\u2019\u2019, that is unconventional and has the capacity to improve the way we engineer errors and dependability in a disruptive manner. This paper first discusses the foundations of software antifragilty, from classical fault tolerance to the most recent advances on automatic software repair and fault injection in production.

      "Abstract": "Most of our interactions with the digital world are mediated by apps: desktop, web, or mobile applications. Apps impose artificial limitations on collaboration among users, distribution across devices, and the changing procedures that constantly occur in real work. These limitations are partially due to the engineering principles of encapsulation and program-data separation. By contrast, the field of hypermedia envisions collaboration, distribution and flexible practices as fundamental features of software. We discuss shareable dynamic media, an alternative model for software that unifies hypermedia and interactive systems, and Webstrates, an experimental implementation of that model. We give examples of patterns and challenges for software architecture that have emerged in our experimentation with Webstrates, and show that it subverts the principles of encapsulation and program-data separation.",

      "Abstract": "The context of this work is specification, detection and ultimately removal of detectable harmful patterns in source code that are associated with defects in design and implementation of software. In particular, we investigate five code smells and four antipatterns previously defined in papers and books. Our inquiry is about detecting those in source code written in Python programming language, which is substantially different from all prior research, most of which concerns Java or C-like languages. Our approach was that of software engineers: we have processed existing research literature on the topic, extracted both the abstract definitions of nine design defects and their concrete implementation specifications, implemented them all in a tool we have programmed and let it loose on a huge test set obtained from open source code from thousands of GitHub projects. When it comes to knowledge, we have found that more than twice as many methods in Python can be considered too long (statistically extremely longer than their neighbours within the same project) than in Java, but long parameter lists are seven times less likely to be found in Python code than in Java code. We have also found that Functional Decomposition, the way it was defined for Java, is not found in the Python code at all, and Spaghetti Code and God Classes are extremely rare there as well. The grounding and the confidence in these results comes from the fact that we have performed our experiments on 32\u2019058\u2019823 lines of Python code, which is by far the largest test set for a freely available Python parser. We have also designed the experiment in such a way that it aligned with prior research on design defect detection in Java in order to ease the comparison if we treat our own actions as a replication. Thus, the importance of the work is both in the unique open Python grammar of highest quality, tested on millions of lines of code, and in the design defect detection tool which works on something else than Java.",

However, the conclusions we draw are largely language-independent, and set out the pragmatics of clone detection and elimination in real-world projects as well as design principles for clone detection decision-support tools.\nThe work gives guidelines that assist an engineer in using clone detection and elimination in practice, as well as helping a tool developer to shape their tool building.

      "Abstract": "Data accessors allow one to read and write components of a data structure, such as the fields of a record, the variants of a union, or the elements of a container. These data accessors are collectively known as optics; they are fundamental to programs that manipulate complex data. Individual data accessors for simple data structures are easy to write, for example as pairs of \u201cgetter\u201d and \u201csetter\u201d methods. However, it is not obvious how to combine data accessors, in such a way that data accessors for a compound data structure are composed out of smaller data accessors for the parts of that structure. Generally, one has to write a sequence of statements or declarations that navigate step by step through the data structure, accessing one level at a time - which is to say, data accessors are traditionally not first-class citizens, combinable in their own right.\nWe present a framework for modular data access, in which individual data accessors for simple data structures may be freely combined to obtain more complex data accessors for compound data structures. Data accessors become first-class citizens. The framework is based around the notion of profunctors, a flexible generalization of functions. The language features required are higher-order functions (\u201clambdas\u201d or \u201cclosures\u201d), parametrized types (\u201cgenerics\u201d or \u201cabstract types\u201d) of higher kind, and some mechanism for separating interfaces from implementations (\u201cabstract classes\u201d or \u201cmodules\u201d). We use Haskell as a vehicle in which to present our constructions, but other languages such as Scala that provide the necessary features should work just as well. We provide implementations of all our constructions, in the form of a literate program: the manuscript file for the paper is also the source code for the program, and the extracted code is available separately for evaluation. Our results should pave the way to simpler ways of writing programs that access the components of compound data structures.",

      "Abstract": "Context: Multidimensional arrays are used by many different algorithms. As such, indexing and broadcasting complex operations over multidimensional arrays are ubiquitous tasks and can be performance limiting. \nInquiry: Simultaneously indexing two or more multidimensional arrays with different shapes (e.g., copying data from one tensor to another larger, zero padded tensor in anticipation of a convolution) is difficult to do efficiently: Hard-coded nested for loops in C, Fortran, and Go cannot be applied when the dimension of a tensor is unknown at compile time. Likewise, boost::multi_array cannot be used unless the dimensions of the array are known at compile time, and the style of implementation restricts the user from using the index tuple inside a vectorized operation (as would be required to compute an expected value of a multidimensional distribution). On the other hand, iteration methods that do not require the dimensionality or shape to be known at compile time (e.g., incrementing and applying carry operations to index tuples or remapping integer indices in the flat array), can be substantially slower than hard-coded nested for loops.\nApproach: Using a few tasks that broadcast operations over multidimensional arrays, several existing methods are compared: hard-coded nested for loops in C and Go, vectorized operations in Fortran, boost::multi_array, numpy, tuple incrementing, and integer reindexing.\nKnowledge: A new approach to this problem, ``template-recursive iteration over tensors\u2019\u2019 (TRIOT), is proposed. This new method, which is made possible by features of C++11, can be used when the dimensions of the tensors are unknown at compile time. Furthermore, the proposed method can access the index tuple inside the vectorized operations, permitting much more flexible operations.\nGrounding: Runtimes of all methods are compared, and demonstrate that the proposed TRIOT method is competitive with both hard-coded nested for loops in C and Go, as well as vectorized operations in Fortran, despite not knowing the dimensions at compile time. TRIOT outperforms boost::multi_array, numpy, tuple incrementing, and integer reindexing.\nImportance: Manipulation of multidimensional arrays is a common task in software, especially in high-performance numerical methods. This paper proposes a novel way to leverage template recursion to iterate over and apply operations to multidimensional arrays, and then demonstrates the superior performance and flexibility of operations that can be achieved using this new approach.",

      "Abstract": "Reversible debuggers and process replay have been developed at least since 1970. This vision enables one to execute backwards in time under a debugger. Two important problems in practice are that, first, current reversible debuggers are slow when reversing over long time periods, and, second, after building one reversible debugger, it is difficult to transfer that achievement to a new programming environment.\nThe user observes a bug when arriving at an error. Searching backwards for the correspond- ing fault may require many reverse steps. Ultimately, the user prefers to write an expression that will transition to false upon arriving at the fault. The solution is an expression-transition watchpoint facility based on top of snapshots and record/replay. Expression-transition watch- points are implemented as binary search through the timeline of a program execution, while using the snapshots as landmarks within that timeline. This allows for debugging of subtle bugs that appear only after minutes or more of program execution. When a bug occurs within seconds of program startup, repeated debugging sessions suffice. Reversible debugging is preferred for bugs seen only after minutes.\nThis architecture allows for an efficient and easy-to-write snapshot-based reversibe debugger on top of a conventional debugger. The validity of this approach was tested by developing four personalities (for GDB, MATLAB, Perl, and Python), with each personality typically requiring just 100 lines of code.",

      "Abstract": "The better developers can learn software tools, the faster they can start using them and the more efficiently they can later work with them. Tutorials are supposed to help here. While in the early days of computing, mostly text tutorials were available, nowadays software developers can choose among a huge number of tutorials for almost any popular software tool. However, only little research was conducted to understand how text tutorials differ from other tutorials, which tutorial types are preferred and, especially, which tutorial types yield the best learning experience in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, especially for programmers.\nTo evaluate these questions, we converted an existing video tutorial for a novel software tool into a content-equivalent text tutorial. We then conducted an experiment in three groups where 42 undergraduate students from a software engineering course were commissioned to operate the software tool after using a tutorial: the first group was provided only with the video tutorial, the second group only with the text tutorial and the third group with both. \nIn this context, the differences in terms of efficiency were almost negligible: We could observe that participants using only the text tutorial completed the tutorial faster than the participants with the video tutorial. However, the participants using only the video tutorial applied the learned content faster, achieving roughly the same bottom line performance. We also found that if both tutorial types are offered, participants prefer video tutorials for learning new content but text tutorials for looking up \u201cmissed\u201d information.\nWe mainly gathered our data through questionnaires and screen recordings and analyzed it with suitable statistical hypotheses tests. The data is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.188896. \nSince producing tutorials requires effort, knowing with which type of tutorial learnability can be increased to which extent has an immense practical relevance. We conclude that in contexts similar to ours, while it would be ideal if software tool makers would offer both tutorial types, it seems more efficient to produce only text tutorials instead of a passive video tutorial - provided you manage to motivate your learners to use them.",

      "Abstract": "Language-oriented modularity (LOM) is a methodology that complements language-oriented programming (LOP) in providing on-demand language abstraction solutions during software development. It involves the implementation and immediate utilization of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that are also aspect-oriented (DSALs). However, while DSL development is affordable thanks to modern language workbenches, DSAL development lacks similar tool support. Consequently, LOM is often impractical and underutilized.\nThe challenge is making the complexity of implementing DSALs comparable to that of DSLs and the effectiveness of programming with DSALs comparable to that of general-purpose aspect languages (GPALs). Today, despite being essentially both domain-specific and aspect-oriented, DSALs seem to be second-class. Aspect development tools (e.g., AJDT) do not work on DSAL code. DSL development tools like language workbenches (e.g., Spoofax) neither deal with the back-end weaving nor handle the composition of DSALs. DSAL composition frameworks (e.g., Awesome) do not provide front-end development tools. DSAL code transformation approaches (e.g., XAspects) do not preserve the semantics of DSAL programs in the presence of other aspect languages.\nTo address this challenge we extend AspectJ with a small set of annotations and interfaces that allows DSAL designers to define a semantic-preserving transformation to AspectJ and interface with AspectJ tools. Our transformation approach enables the use of a standard language workbench to implement DSALs and use of standard aspect development tools to program with these DSALs. As a result, DSALs regain their first-class status with respect to both DSLs and aspect languages. This, on the one hand, lowers the cost of developing DSALs to the level of DSLs and, on the other hand, raises the effectiveness of using a DSAL to the level of a GPAL. Consequently, LOM becomes cost-effective compared to the LOP baseline.\nAs validation, we modified the ajc compiler to support our approach. Using two different language workbenches (Spoofax and Xtext) we then implemented several DSALs. We implemented Cool to demonstrate that the non-trivial composition of AspectJ and Cool can be accommodated using our approach. We applied LOM to crosscutting concerns in two open source projects (oVirt and muCommander), implementing in the process application-specific DSALs, thus providing a sense of the decrease in the cost of developing composable DSALs and the increase in the effectiveness of programming with them.\nCrosscutting concerns remain a problem in modern real-world projects (e.g., as observed in oVirt). DSALs are often the right tool for addressing these concerns. Our work makes LOM practical, thus facilitating the use of DSAL solutions in the software development process.",

      "Abstract": "We demonstrate, how to implement interactive applications with Reactive Programming (RP). Our RP framework REScala provides RP abstractions as an embedded domain-specific language in Scala. The demo begins with a simple animation to introduce Signals and Events, the fundamental RP abstractions. We incrementally evolve the animation into a Pong-style game, exploring increasingly advanced features of RP. We demonstrate, how RP enables declarative implementation of modular designs of interactive applications. We discuss additional benefits provided by these abstractions, such as strong consistency for concurrent applications provided by REScala. Finally, we showcase how REScala enables implementation of distributed RP applications, by extending the Pong-style game with local network multi-player.",

      "Abstract": "Modern software development without reactive programming is hard to imagine. Reactive programming favors a wide class of contemporary software systems that respond to user input, network messages, and other events.\nWhile reactive programming is an active field of research, the implementation of reactive concepts remains challenging. In particular, change detection represents a hard but inevitable necessity when implementing reactive concepts. Typically, change detection mechanisms are not intended for reuse but are tightly coupled to the particular change resolution mechanism. As a result, developers often have to re-implement similar abstractions. A reusable primitive for change detection is still missing.\nTo find a suitable primitive, we identify commonalities in existing reactive concepts. We discover a class of reactive concepts, state-based reactive concepts. All state-based reactive concepts share a common change detection mechanism: they detect changes in the evaluation result of an expression.\nOn the basis of the identified common change detection mechanism, we propose active expressions as a reusable primitive. By abstracting the tedious implementation details of change detection, active expressions can ease the implementation of reactive programming concepts.\nWe evaluate the design of active expressions by re-implementing a number of existing state-based reactive concepts using them. The resulting implementations highlight the expressiveness of active expressions.\nActive expressions enable the separation of essential from non-essential parts when reasoning about reactive programming concepts. By using active expressions as a primitive for change detection, developers of reactive language constructs and runtime support can now focus on the design of how application programmers should be able to react to change. Ultimately, we would like active expressions to encourage experiments with novel reactive programming concepts and with that to yield a wider variety of them to explore.",

      "Abstract": "Extensible programming languages are the next big thing. Decades of work on programming-language design have given us powerful abstractions that cover a large problem space, but no one abstraction can close the gap between a programming language and all programming problems. When a programming language is extensible, a programmer can afford to create the right abstraction to solve each problem.\nRacket\u2019s Lisp and Scheme heritage gives it a head start on language extensibility, but Scheme\u2019s macro system turned out to be a starting point instead of a conclusion. The practice of building Racket and building applications has drawn us continually back the problem of building languages and composable language extensions.\nWe have been able to grow the idea of macros to the more expressive and convenient facilities that are found in Racket today. Key elements include a novel model of scope, a module system that enforces a phase separation, submodules that generalize program phases, and improved pattern-parsing and error-reporting libraries. These elements take on a specific flavor in our macro setting, but each element also reflects a general problem and points to a fundamental solution that designers of extensible languages can embrace.",

      "Abstract": "The context of this research is testing and building software systems and, specifically, software language repositories (SLRs), i.e., repositories with components for language processing (interpreters, translators, analyzers, transformers, pretty printers, etc.). SLRs are typically set up for developing and using metaprogramming systems, language workbenches, language definition frameworks, executable semantic frameworks, and modeling frameworks.\nThis work is an inquiry into testing and building SLRs in a manner that the repository is seen as a collection of language-typed artifacts being related by the applications of language-typed functions or relations which serve language processing. The notion of language is used in a broad sense to include text-, tree-, graph-based languages as well as representations based on interchange formats and also proprietary formats for serialization.\nThe overall approach underlying this research is one of language design driven by a complex case study, i.e., a specific SLR with a significant number of processed languages and language processors as well as a noteworthy heterogeneity in terms of representation types and implementation languages.\nThe knowledge gained by our research is best understood as a declarative language design for regression testing and build management; we introduce a corresponding language Ueber with an executable semantics which maintains relationships between language-typed artifacts in an SLR.\nThe grounding of the reported research is based on the comprehensive, formal, executable (logic programming-based) definition of the Ueber language and its systematic application to the management of the SLR YAS which consists of hundreds of language definition and processing components (such as interpreters and transformations) for more than thirty languages (not counting different representation types) with Prolog, Haskell, Java, and Python being used as implementation languages.\nThe importance of this work follows from the significant costs implied by regression testing and build management and also from the complexity of SLRs which calls for means to help with understanding.",

      "Abstract": "Application embedding is a technique for developing web applications. It divides the implementation of an application to two artifacts: \n \n A host application \u2013 a platform that is agnostic of any particular application, and \n the application\u2019s definition \u2013 specifying one particular application in a declarative manner. \n\nFishTank is an example of a host application for application embedding. In this demo we present our work in progress on Axiom, a host application for application embedding as an alternative to Fishtank. Axiom (similar to FishTank) is based on the a conceptual data language called Cloudlog. However, Axiom (unlike FishTank) uses Clojure both as its host language and as its implementation language.\nThe use of Clouldlog-over-Clojure instead of Cloudlog-over-Cedalion (as done in FishTank) brings several important benefits. First, Clojure makes Axiom potentially more approachable for developers than FishTalk which is based on Cedalion. Second, Clojure has a rich ecosystem that can benefit both the implementation of Axiom itself, and both the applications built on top of it. Third, Clojure is compiled to Java Bytecode and runs on the JVM, making it (and in particular, rules written by developers on top of it) run much faster than rules written in Cedalion. Fourth, Clojure\u2019s integration with the Java ecosystem opens the door to using big-data platforms (specifically, we use Apache Storm). The use of Clouldlog-over-Clojure also presents new challenges. Clojure (like most LISPs) is homoiconic but impure. To allow Cloudlog to be correctly defined over Clojure we had to create a pure subset of Clojure, which we call permacode.\nThe demo will provide an overview on application embedding and will compare the embedding of simple applications in FishTank to their embedding in Axiom.",

      "Abstract": "The context of the reported research is the documentation of software technologies such as object/relational mappers, web-application frameworks, or code generators. We assume that documentation should model a macroscopic view on usage scenarios of technologies in terms of involved artifacts, leveraged soft- ware languages, transformation and conformance relationships, I/O behavior, and others. In previous work, we referred to such documentation also as \u2018linguistic architecture\u2019. The corresponding models may also be referred to as \u2018megamodels\u2019 while adopting this term from the technological space of modeling/model-driven engineering. This work is an inquiry into making such documentation more useful by means of connecting (mega)models, systems, and developer experience in several ways. To this end, we adopt an approach that is primarily based on prototyping (i.e., implementation of a megamodeling infrastructure with all conceivable connections) and experimentation with showcases (i.e., documentation of concrete software technologies). The knowledge gained by this research is a notion of interconnected linguistic architecture on the grounds of connecting primary model elements, inferred model elements, static and runtime system artifacts, traceability links, system contexts, knowledge resources, plugged interpretations of model elements, and IDE views. A corresponding suite of aspects of interconnected linguistic architecture is systematically described. As to the grounding of this research, we describe a literature survey which tracks scattered occurrences and thus demonstrates the relevance of the identified aspects of interconnected linguistic architecture. Further, we describe the MegaL/Xtext+IDE infrastructure which realizes interconnected linguistic architecture. The importance of this work lies in providing relatively formal, ontologically rich, navigable, and verifiable documentation of software technologies, thereby helping developers to better understand how to use technologies in new systems (prescriptive mode) or how technologies are used in existing systems (descriptive mode).",

      "Abstract": "User-defined syntax extensions are useful to implement an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) with good code-readability. They allow EDSL authors to define domain-natural notation, which is often different from the host language syntax. Nowadays, there are several research works of powerful user-defined syntax extensions.\nOne promising approach uses user-defined operators. A user-defined operator is a function with user-defined syntax. It can be regarded as a syntax extension implemented without macros. An advantage of user-defined operators is that an operator can be statically typed. The compiler can find type errors in the definition of an operator before the operator is used. In addition, the compiler can resolve syntactic ambiguities by using static types. However, user-defined operators are difficult to implement language constructs involving static name binding. Name binding is association between names and values (or memory locations). Our inquiry is whether we can design a system for user-defined operators involving a new custom name binding.\nThis paper proposes a variant of a lambda expression, named a context-sensitive expression. A context-sensitive expression looks like a normal expression but it implicitly takes parameters. To realize user-defined name binding, these parameters are accessed through public members such as methods and operators of one parameter object instead of through parameter names. Programmers can emulate name binding by such methods or operators, for example, they can emulate a local variable through getter operator and setter operator. We also present turnstile type to give a type to a context-sensitive expression, DSL class to cooperate with syntax extension, and generic name to recognize arbitrary names given by users.\nA contribution of this paper is that we reveal we can integrate a system for managing names and their scopes with a module and type system of an object-oriented language like Java. Programmers can define new language constructs involving custom name binding and another programmers can use them by importing modules. The compiler can statically verify the types of both the definition and usage of the language constructs.\nWe have implemented ProteaJ2, which is a programming language based on Java and it supports our proposal. We describe a parsing method that adopts eager disambiguation for fast parsing and discuss its time complexity. To show the practicality of our proposal, we have conducted two micro benchmarks to see the performance of our compiler. We also show several use cases of DSL classes for demonstrating DSL classes can express various language constructs.\nOur ultimate goal is to let programmers add any kind of new language construct to a host language. To do this, programmers should be able to define new syntax, name binding, and type system within the host language. This paper shows programmers can define name binding with their own syntax.",

      "Abstract": "Context. Variability-intensive programs (program families) appear in many application areas and for many reasons today. Different family members, called variants, are derived by switching statically configurable options (features) on and off, while reuse of the common code is maximized. \nInquiry. Verification of program families is challenging since the number of variants is exponential in the number of features. Existing single-program analysis and verification tools cannot be applied directly to program families, and designing and implementing the corresponding variability-aware versions is tedious and laborious.\nApproach. In this work, we propose a range of variability-related transformations for translating program families into single programs by replacing compile-time variability with run-time variability (non-determinism). The obtained transformed programs can be subsequently analyzed using the conventional off- the-shelf single-program analysis tools such as type checkers, symbolic executors, model checkers, and static analyzers. \nKnowledge. Our variability-related transformations are outcome-preserving, which means that the relation between the outcomes in the transformed single program and the union of outcomes of all variants derived from the original program family is equality.\nGrounding. We show our transformation rules and their correctness with respect to a minimal core imperative language IMP. Then, we discuss our experience of implementing and using the transformations for efficient and effective analysis and verification of real-world C program families. \nImportance. We report some interesting variability-related bugs that we discovered using various state-of-the-art single-program C verification tools, such as Frama-C, Clang, LLBMC.",

In fact, ominous warnings about the desperate state of the software industry continue to be released with almost ritualistic regularity. In this paper, we look at the 60 years history of programming and at the different practical methods that software community developed to live with programming errors. \nWe do so by observing a class of students discussing different approaches to programming errors. While learning about the different methods for dealing with errors, we uncover basic assumptions that proponents of different paradigms follow. We learn about the mathematical attempt to eliminate errors through formal methods, scientific method based on testing, a way of building reliable systems through engineering methods, as well as an artistic approach to live coding that accepts errors as a creative inspiration. \nThis way, we can explore the differences and similarities among the different paradigms. By inviting proponents of different methods into a single discussion, we hope to open potential for new thinking about errors. When should we use which of the approaches? And what can software development learn from mathematics, science, engineering and art? \nWhen programming or studying programming, we are often enclosed in small communities and we take our basic assumptions for granted. Through the discussion in this paper, we attempt to map the large and rich space of programming ideas and provide reference points for exploring, perhaps foreign, ideas that can challenge some of our assumptions.",

      "Abstract": "Model-driven development is a pragmatic approach to software development that embraces domain-specific languages (DSLs), where models correspond to DSL programs. A distinguishing feature of model-driven development is that clients of a model can select from an open set of alternative semantics of the model by applying different model transformations. However, in existing model-driven frameworks, dependencies between models, model transformations, and generated code artifacts are either implicit or globally declared in build scripts, which impedes modular reasoning, separate compilation, and programmability in general.\nWe propose the design of a new module system that incorporates models and model transformations as modules. A programmer can apply transformations in import statements, thus declaring a dependency on generated code artifacts. Our design enables modular reasoning and separate compilation by preventing hidden dependencies, and it supports mixing modeling artifacts with conventional code artifacts as well as higher-order transformations. We have formalized our design and the aforementioned properties and have validated it by an implementation and case studies that show that our module system successfully integrates model-driven development into conventional programming languages.",

      "Abstract": "In common object-oriented code, user acceptance tests, which play a very important role in any kind of software development process and which follow procedural modularization, would be scattered and, consequently, hard to maintain. This is of particular importance, since it is known that user acceptance tests immensely improve code comprehension, as can be seen in the Cucumber approach.\nBoth use case and test driven modularizations remain compatible while at the same time open new capabilities of having different views on software based on use cases and various tests simultaneously. The environment synchronizes changes in multiple modularizations at the level of static file processing and enforces use case and test representations in code by displaying a percentage of how well use cases and tests are covered by code.\nWe will demonstrate how use case and test driven modularization supported by our environment (avaliable at useion.com), which is based on our previous work on literal inter-language use case driven modularization, simplifies development and maintenance of a real world application of 55 use cases built on the OpenCart e-commerce platform.\nThe development of selected simple and complex use cases and tests will be presented. However, the main aim of the demonstration will be to present how our environment helps developers respond effectively to common change requests using object-oriented, use case driven, and test driven modularization interchangeably.\n(Supported by the Scientific Grant Agency of Slovak Republic (VEGA) under the grant No. VG 1/0808/17, Research &amp; Development Operational Programme for the project Research of Methods for Acquisition, Analysis and Personalized Conveying of Information and Knowledge, ITMS 26240220039, co-funded by the ERDF, and STU Grant scheme for Support of Young Researchers (M.

      "Abstract": "Context: This paper presents the concept of open programming language interpreters, a model to support them and a prototype implementation in the Neverlang framework for modular development of programming languages.\nInquiry: We address the problem of dynamic interpreter adaptation to tailor the interpreter\u2019s behaviour on the task to be solved and to introduce new features to fulfil unforeseen requirements. Many languages provide a meta-object protocol (MOP) that to some degree supports reflection. However, MOPs are typically language-specific, their reflective functionality is often restricted, and the adaptation and application logic are often mixed which hardens the understanding and maintenance of the source code. Our system overcomes these limitations.\nApproach: We designed a model and implemented a prototype system to support open programming language interpreters. The implementation is integrated in the Neverlang framework which now exposes the structure, behaviour and the runtime state of any Neverlang-based interpreter with the ability to modify it. \nKnowledge: Our system provides a complete control over interpreter\u2019s structure, behaviour and its runtime state. The approach is applicable to every Neverlang-based interpreter. Adaptation code can potentially be reused across different language implementations. \nGrounding: Having a prototype implementation we focused on feasibility evaluation. The paper shows that our approach well addresses problems commonly found in the research literature. We have a demonstrative video and examples that illustrate our approach on dynamic software adaptation, aspect-oriented programming, debugging and context-aware interpreters.\nImportance: Our paper presents the first reflective approach targeting a general framework for language development. Our system provides full reflective support for free to any Neverlang-based interpreter. Rather than substituting other approaches, we believe our system can be used as a complementary technique in situations where other approaches present serious limitations.",

      "Abstract": "Live programming environments enable programmers to edit a running program and obtain immediate feedback on each individual change. The liveness quality is valued by programmers to help work in small steps and continuously add or correct small functionality while maintaining the impression of a direct connection between each edit and its manifestation at run-time. Such immediacy may conflict with the desire to perform a combined set of intermediate steps, such as a refactoring, without immediately taking effect after each individual edit. This becomes important when an incomplete sequence of small-scale changes can easily break the running program.\nState-of-the-art solutions focus on retroactive recovery mechanisms, such as debugging or version control. In contrast, we propose a proactive approach: Multiple individual changes to the program are collected in an Edit Transaction, which can be made effective if deemed complete. Upon activation, the combined steps become visible together.\nEdit Transactions are capable of dynamic scoping, allowing a set of changes to be tested in isolation before being extended to the running application. This enables a live programming workflow with full control over change granularity, immediate feedback on tests, delayed effect on the running application, and coarse-grained undos. \nWe present an implementation of Edit Transactions along with Edit-Transaction-aware tools in Squeak/Smalltalk. We asses this implementation by conducting a case study with and without the new tool support, comparing programming activities, errors, and detours for implementing new functionality in a running simulation. We conclude that workflows using Edit Transactions have the potential to increase confidence in a change, reduce potential for run-time errors, and eventually make live programming more predictable and engaging.",

      "Abstract": "Development of embedded systems has been receiving in last decade a considerable attention for both academy and industry. Advances in hardware miniaturization, in particular, single-boards computers like Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone Black, allow for the use of high-level programming languages. Still, the greatest challenges when developing IoT applications are distribution and coordination. To date, mainstream languages (e.g. Java, JavaScript, Python) lack high- level abstractions to deal with distribution and coordination. For example, implementing standard leader election algorithms (e.g., Ring, Bully) with these languages, force developers to write code on top of low-level networking APIs. As a result, programmers need to write over and over, aspects like the discovery of peers, coordination, failure handling necessary for implementing distributed algorithms. Furthermore, craft and deploy such systems on embedded devices is also complex, due to hardware restrictions and software dependencies. In this demo, we show how a concurrent and distributed language with a rich macro system could in an easy and declarative way solve these problems. Our demo recreates a leader election algorithm between the nodes in an embedded environment by employing a Raspberry Pi cluster. The code for the leader election algorithm is built on top of a macro-based Elixir library which includes abstractions for distribution and coordination. Developers can use this library to translate core operations described by the Bully algorithm to declarative macro-constructs. This library also abstracts develop- ers of communication and network concerns (e.g. service discovery and network monitoring). Furthermore, it includes an implementation of an Elixir behaviour to provide a base skeleton for developing leader-election applications.",

      "Abstract": "Since the early days of the Web, web application developers have aspired to develop much of their applications declaratively. However, one aspect of the application, namely its business-logic is constantly left imperative. In this work we present Application Embedding, a novel approach to application development which allows all aspects of an application, including its business-logic, to be programmed declaratively. \nWe achieve this approach in a two-step process. First, we draw a mapping between Web applications and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). Second, we note that out of the two methods for implementing DSLs, namely as internal and external DSLs, most traditional Web applications correspond to external DSLs, while the the technique that corresponds to DSL embedding (implementing internal DSLs) is left mostly unexplored. \nBy projecting the well-known technique of DSL embedding to web applications, we derive our novel technique \u2013 Application Embedding. Application embedding offers a separation of code assets that encourages reuse of imperative code, while keeping all application-specific assets, including those specifying its business-logic, declarative. \nAs validation, we implemented a simple, though nontrivial web application using the proposed separation of assets. This implementation includes an application-agnostic imperative host application named Fish-Tank, intended to be applicable for a wide variety of such applications, and a declarative definition of the different aspects of the specific application, intended to be loaded on that host. \nThis novel separation of code assets facilitates a better separation of work, in comparison to traditional methods. By this separation, host application developers can focus mostly on the extra-functional aspects of a web application, namely on improving performance, scalability and availability, while developers of an embedded application can focus on the functional aspects of their application, without worrying about extra-functional concerns. The reusability of the host application can make it cost-effective to put much effort into a better implementation, which can benefit all applications built on top of it.",

      "Abstract": "Context: In the context of exploring the art, science and engineering of programming, the question of which programming languages should be taught first has been fiercely debated since computer science teaching started in universities. Failure to grasp programming readily almost certainly implies failure to progress in computer science.\nInquiry: What first programming languages are being taught? There have been regular national-scale surveys in Australia and New Zealand, with the only US survey reporting on a small subset of universities. This the first such national survey of universities in the UK.\nApproach: We report the results of the first survey of introductory programming courses (N=80) taught at UK universities as part of their first year computer science (or related) degree programmes, conducted in the first half of 2016. We report on student numbers, programming paradigm, programming languages and environment/tools used, as well as the underpinning rationale for these choices.\nKnowledge: The results in this first UK survey indicate a dominance of Java at a time when universities are still generally teaching students who are new to programming (and computer science), despite the fact that Python is perceived, by the same respondents, to be both easier to teach as well as to learn.\nGrounding: We compare the results of this survey with a related survey conducted since 2010 (as well as earlier surveys from 2001 and 2003) in Australia and New Zealand.\nImportance: This survey provides a starting point for valuable pedagogic baseline data for the analysis of the art, science and engineering of programming, in the context of substantial computer science curriculum reform in UK schools, as well as increasing scrutiny of teaching excellence and graduate employability for UK universities.",

Since October 2011, I have also been part of the HPI Research School after getting my Master\u2019s degree in Software Engineering at the HPI, too.\nMy research activities include the area of building tools for programmers, especially data-driven ones for program comprehension tasks. For this, direct manipulation concepts, dynamic analysis, and cooperation of distributed teams in agile processes play an important role. Additionally, I investigate modularity concepts with respect to critical software quality metrics such as extensibility and maintainability while reasoning about interdependencies between languages and tools.",

Joe serves as president of the board of The Hillside Group, a group dedicated to improving the quality of life of everyone who uses, builds, and encounters software systems. He is best known as an author of the Big Ball of Mud pattern, which illuminates many fallacies in software architecture. Joe teaches and mentors developers on agile and lean practices, architecture, building flexible systems, clean design, patterns, refactoring, and testing. Joe thinks software is still too hard to change. He wants to do something about this and believes that you can start solving this problem through the use of best practices (patterns) and by putting the ability to change software into the hands of the people with the knowledge to change it.\nJoe has recently been innovating, collecting and writing on the best practices and patterns on Being Agile at Quality. During this time he has given presentations, workshops, and keynotes at various conferences and in industrial settings. He has published (and continues writing and collecting) over two dozen patterns on this topic. Joe have also been working with organizations on the best practices for Agile Quality Assurance, helping them apply these techniques, and has shepherded Agile Experience reports on the topic. Variations of this some of this material has been presented as talks and workshop/tutorials at various conferences (Agile, JDD in Poland, SugarLoaf PLoP, Agile Portugal, AgileBrazil, YOW! in Australia, Saturn, and Israel Conference on Software Architecture) and to some of Joe\u2019s clients. In 2015 Joe won the New Directions award with a colleague at Saturn 2015, given to the presentation that best describes innovative new approaches and thought leadership in the application of architecture-centric practices for his presentation QA to AQ: Shifting from Quality Assurance to Agile Quality (see here).",

      "Abstract": "When developing current-day software systems, their deployment and usage environments should be considered carefully, in order to understand the adaptations those systems might need to undergo to interact with other systems and with their environment. Moreover, due to the portability, mobility and increasingly evolutionary nature of software systems, such adaptations should be enacted even while the system is running. Developing such software systems can prove challenging, and many seemingly different techniques to address this concern have been proposed over the last couple of years.\nThe intention of the LASSY workshop is to congregate all topics relevant to dynamic adaptation and run-time evolution of software systems, ranging from a computer science perspective covering the domains of programming languages, model-driven software development, software and service composition, context-aware databases, software variability, requirements engineering, UI adaptation and other domains, to a human perspective covering sociological or ethical implications of dynamic software systems. The workshop provides a space for discussion and collaboration between researchers working on the problem of enabling live adaptations to software systems, across the development stack.",

      "Abstract": "Welcome to the 2nd Edition of the Programming Experience Workshop \n   \n \n\nImagine a software development task: some sort of requirements and specification including performance goals and perhaps a platform and programming language. A group of developers head into a vast workroom. In that room they discover they need to explore the domain and the nature of potential solutions\u2014they need exploratory programming.\nThe Programming Experience (PX) Workshop is about what happens in that room when one or a couple of programmers sit down in front of computers and produce code, especially when it\u2019s exploratory programming. Do they create text that is transformed into running behavior (the old way), or do they operate on behavior directly (\u201cliveness\u201d); are they exploring the live domain to understand the true nature of the requirements; are they like authors creating new worlds; does visualization matter; is the experience immediate, immersive, vivid and continuous; do fluency, literacy, and learning matter; do they build tools, meta-tools; are they creating languages to express new concepts quickly and easily; and curiously, is joy relevant to the experience?\nCorrectness, performance, standard tools, foundations, and text-as-program are important traditional research areas, but the experience of programming and how to improve and evolve it are the focus of this workshop, and in this edition we would like to focus on exploratory programming.\nFlyer\nhttp://programming-experience.org/px17/media/PX17CfP.pdf\nhttp://programming-experience.org/px17/",

      "Abstract": "Modularity in Modelling Workshop\nExtending the time-honored practice of separation of concerns, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) promotes the use of separate models to address the various concerns in the development of complex software-intensive systems. The main objective is to choose the right level of abstraction to modularize a concern, specify its properties and reason about the system under development depending on stakeholder and development needs. While some of these models can be defined with a single modelling language, a variety of heterogeneous models and languages are typically used in the various phases of software development. Furthermore, Domain-Specific Modelling Languages designed to address particular concerns are also increasingly used.\nDespite the power of abstraction of modelling, models of real-world problems and systems quickly grow to such an extent that managing the complexity by using proper modularization techniques becomes necessary. As a result, many (standard) modelling notations have been extended with aspect-oriented mechanisms and advanced composition operators to support advanced separation of concerns, to combine (possibly heterogeneous) models modularizing different concerns, to execute an application based on modularized models, and to reason over global properties of modularized models.\nThe Second International Modularity in Modelling Workshop (MOMO) brings together researchers and practitioners interested in the theoretical and practical challenges resulting from applying modularity, advanced separation of concerns, and advanced composition at the modelling level. It is intended to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and discussing the impact of the use of modularization in the context of MDE at different levels of abstraction.\nExternal Website\nInformation about MOMO 2017 can be found on:http://www.momo2017.ece.mcgill.ca/",

      "Abstract": "The landscape of computation platforms has changed dramatically in recent years. Emerging systems - such as wearable devices, smartphones, unmanned aerial vehicles, Internet of things, cloud computing servers, heterogeneous clusters, and data centers - pose a distinct set of system-oriented challenges ranging from data throughput, energy efficiency, security, real-time guarantees, to high performance. In the meantime, code quality, such as modularity or extensibility, remains a cornerstone in modern software engineering, bringing in crucial benefits such as modular reasoning, program understanding, and collaborative software development. Current methodologies and software development technologies should be revised in order to produce software to meet system-oriented goals, while preserving high internal code quality. The role of the Software Engineer is essential, having to be aware of the implications that each design, architecture and implementation decision has on the application system ecosystem.\nThis workshop is driven by one fundamental question: How does internal code quality interact with system-oriented goals? We welcome both positive and negative responses to this question. An example of the former would be modular reasoning systems specifically designed to promote system-oriented goals, whereas an example of the latter would be anti-patterns against system-oriented goals during software development.\nA preliminary program is available under the tab \u201cProgram\u201d.",

Moreover, due to the portability, mobility and increasingly evolutionary nature of software systems, such adaptations should be enacted even while the system is running. Developing such software systems can prove challenging, and many seemingly different techniques to address this concern have been proposed over the last couple of years.\nThe intention of the LASSY workshop is to congregate all topics relevant to dynamic adaptation and run-time evolution of software systems, ranging from a computer science perspective covering the domains of programming languages, model-driven software development, software and service composition, context-aware databases, software variability, requirements engineering, UI adaptation and other domains, to a human perspective covering sociological or ethical implications of dynamic software systems. The workshop provides a space for discussion and collaboration between researchers working on the problem of enabling live adaptations to software systems, across the development stack.",

The growing interest in Design Patterns, Architectural Patterns, Analysis Patterns, Pedagogical Patterns, Agile Patterns, and so on, represents an effort to catalog and better communicate knowledge, providing handbooks of proven solutions to common problems.\nMiniPLoP brings together researchers, educators, and practitioners whose interests span a remarkably broad range of topics and who share an interest in exploring the power of the pattern form. MiniPLoP invites you to add your expertise to the growing corpus of patterns. MiniPLoP focuses on improving the expression of patterns. You will have the opportunity to refine and extend your patterns or pattern ideas with the help from knowledgeable and sympathetic fellow pattern enthusiasts. You will also be able to discuss applications of patterns in industry and academia. Techniques for Pattern Mining will also be presented.\nHighlights include group discussions on patterns, an introduction to pattern writing, an international keynote, and a writers\u2019 workshop. This MiniPLoP at \u2039Programming\u203a 2017 has the goal to help beginners learn more about the pattern community.\nMiniPLoP Format\nWe will use writers\u2019 workshops, adapted from the workshops of literary circles, to provide highly concentrated feedback to authors. This format has been extensively used in software pattern conferences (the so called PLoP conferences) to improve patterns, as well as other writings associated with patterns, such as research papers on application of patterns.

      "Abstract": "Modularity in Modelling Workshop\nExtending the time-honored practice of separation of concerns, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) promotes the use of separate models to address the various concerns in the development of complex software-intensive systems. The main objective is to choose the right level of abstraction to modularize a concern, specify its properties and reason about the system under development depending on stakeholder and development needs. While some of these models can be defined with a single modelling language, a variety of heterogeneous models and languages are typically used in the various phases of software development. Furthermore, Domain-Specific Modelling Languages designed to address particular concerns are also increasingly used.\nDespite the power of abstraction of modelling, models of real-world problems and systems quickly grow to such an extent that managing the complexity by using proper modularization techniques becomes necessary. As a result, many (standard) modelling notations have been extended with aspect-oriented mechanisms and advanced composition operators to support advanced separation of concerns, to combine (possibly heterogeneous) models modularizing different concerns, to execute an application based on modularized models, and to reason over global properties of modularized models.\nThe Second International Modularity in Modelling Workshop (MOMO) brings together researchers and practitioners interested in the theoretical and practical challenges resulting from applying modularity, advanced separation of concerns, and advanced composition at the modelling level. It is intended to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and discussing the impact of the use of modularization in the context of MDE at different levels of abstraction.\nExternal Website\nInformation about MOMO 2017 can be found on:http://www.momo2017.ece.mcgill.ca/",

      "Abstract": "The landscape of computation platforms has changed dramatically in recent years. Emerging systems - such as wearable devices, smartphones, unmanned aerial vehicles, Internet of things, cloud computing servers, heterogeneous clusters, and data centers - pose a distinct set of system-oriented challenges ranging from data throughput, energy efficiency, security, real-time guarantees, to high performance. In the meantime, code quality, such as modularity or extensibility, remains a cornerstone in modern software engineering, bringing in crucial benefits such as modular reasoning, program understanding, and collaborative software development. Current methodologies and software development technologies should be revised in order to produce software to meet system-oriented goals, while preserving high internal code quality. The role of the Software Engineer is essential, having to be aware of the implications that each design, architecture and implementation decision has on the application system ecosystem.\nThis workshop is driven by one fundamental question: How does internal code quality interact with system-oriented goals? We welcome both positive and negative responses to this question. An example of the former would be modular reasoning systems specifically designed to promote system-oriented goals, whereas an example of the latter would be anti-patterns against system-oriented goals during software development.\nA preliminary program is available under the tab \u201cProgram\u201d.",

Do they create text that is transformed into running behavior (the old way), or do they operate on behavior directly (\u201cliveness\u201d); are they exploring the live domain to understand the true nature of the requirements; are they like authors creating new worlds; does visualization matter; is the experience immediate, immersive, vivid and continuous; do fluency, literacy, and learning matter; do they build tools, meta-tools; are they creating languages to express new concepts quickly and easily; and curiously, is joy relevant to the experience?\nCorrectness, performance, standard tools, foundations, and text-as-program are important traditional research areas, but the experience of programming and how to improve and evolve it are the focus of this workshop, and in this edition we would like to focus on exploratory programming.\nFlyer\nhttp://programming-experience.org/px17/media/PX17CfP.pdf\nhttp://programming-experience.org/px17/",

      "Abstract": "Software developers and those involved with programming have long observed that certain patterns recur and endure across different applications and systems. The growing interest in Design Patterns, Architectural Patterns, Analysis Patterns, Pedagogical Patterns, Agile Patterns, and so on, represents an effort to catalog and better communicate knowledge, providing handbooks of proven solutions to common problems.\nMiniPLoP brings together researchers, educators, and practitioners whose interests span a remarkably broad range of topics and who share an interest in exploring the power of the pattern form. MiniPLoP invites you to add your expertise to the growing corpus of patterns. MiniPLoP focuses on improving the expression of patterns. You will have the opportunity to refine and extend your patterns or pattern ideas with the help from knowledgeable and sympathetic fellow pattern enthusiasts. You will also be able to discuss applications of patterns in industry and academia. Techniques for Pattern Mining will also be presented.\nHighlights include group discussions on patterns, an introduction to pattern writing, an international keynote, and a writers\u2019 workshop. This MiniPLoP at \u2039Programming\u203a 2017 has the goal to help beginners learn more about the pattern community.\nMiniPLoP Format\nWe will use writers\u2019 workshops, adapted from the workshops of literary circles, to provide highly concentrated feedback to authors. This format has been extensively used in software pattern conferences (the so called PLoP conferences) to improve patterns, as well as other writings associated with patterns, such as research papers on application of patterns. A description of writers\u2019 workshops in pattern conferences can be found at: http://www.europlop.net/content/conference-elements#writersworkshops\nMiniPLoP will include the following: \n \n A keynote address by Takashi Iba \n Introduction to writers\u2019 workshops \n Writers\u2019 workshop \n Pattern mining techniques \n\nOrganizers: Ademar Aguiar, Richard Gabriel, and Joseph Yoder\nFor more information contact: miniplop2017@hillside.net\nSchedule: Monday April 3rd in Room D2.09 \n \n 09:00\u201310:30: Opening (Richard, Joe, and Ademar) \u2013 Keynote (Takashi Iba) \n 10:30\u201311:00: coffee break \n 11:00\u201312:00: Pattern Mining Workshop (Takashi and Joe) \n 12:00\u201313:30: lunch \n 13:30\u201315:00: Games and Writers\u2019 Workshop (Richard) \n 15:00\u201315:30: coffee break \n 15:30\u201317:00: Writers\u2019 Workshop and Closing (Richard, Joe, and Ademar)",

      "Abstract": "OPTIMAL MODULARITY AND COMPOSITION:\nFROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND ARCHITECTURES\n \nThe area of software technology is very dynamic\nMany new techniques and architectures have been introduced in the past decade: self-aware systems (adaptive, learning, optimizing, etc.), cyber-physical systems, event-based systems, emergent systems, hybrid-control systems, systems of systems, eco-systems, big-data management systems, cloud architectures, software-defined networks, distributed sensor systems, ubiquitous systems, secure and safe systems, fault-tolerant systems, high-performance systems are some examples. \nSoftware intensive systems are becoming extremely complex\nWith the emergence of new techniques and architectures, the complexity of software intensive systems continue to grow. To maximally profit from the recent advancements of technologies, however, software intensive systems must be designed, implemented, verified and maintained in a cost-effective way. Complexity is the major obstacle in accomplishing these objectives. As such, many \u201cgood ideas\u201d may never be realized in practice, unless complexity is managed.\nEffective modularity and composition\nEffective decomposition of systems into modules and/or composition of modules into systems are two major ways of reducing complexity. However, variations of the concepts in the application domains and increased dynamicity in runtime environments make traditional module-based abstractions less suitable. New ways of defining modules and composition mechanisms are necessary. Moreover, effective decomposition and composition require expressive quality models and efficient trade-off analysis techniques. To this aim, it is crucial to understand the modularity and composition needs of the emerging techniques and architectures. \nMuch has been accomplished in modularization and composition\nDuring the last two decades, extensive research work has been carried out to modularize and compose complex systems. For example, object-oriented programming, component-oriented programming, reflective-programming, aspect-oriented programming, context-oriented programming, model-driven engineering, feature-oriented programming, event-based programming and their variations have been introduced. Furthermore, incremental verification and testing techniques have been developed to assure correctly functioning systems. Obviously, to be able to address the problems of the future, we need to understand very well the techniques introduced in the past, in particular in terms of their potential benefits and their limitations.\nThis symposium aims to address the challenges of optimal decomposition and effective composition for emergent software techniques and architectures from two perspectives: (1) Assessment of the state-of-the-art techniques and methods, and (2) modularization and composition challenges in designing today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s software intensive systems.\nAbout Modularity \n \n Modularity website: http://modularity.info/ \n Modularity conference past editions: http://modularity.info/conference/",

      "Abstract": "Modularity in Modelling Workshop\nExtending the time-honored practice of separation of concerns, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) promotes the use of separate models to address the various concerns in the development of complex software-intensive systems. The main objective is to choose the right level of abstraction to modularize a concern, specify its properties and reason about the system under development depending on stakeholder and development needs. While some of these models can be defined with a single modelling language, a variety of heterogeneous models and languages are typically used in the various phases of software development. Furthermore, Domain-Specific Modelling Languages designed to address particular concerns are also increasingly used.\nDespite the power of abstraction of modelling, models of real-world problems and systems quickly grow to such an extent that managing the complexity by using proper modularization techniques becomes necessary. As a result, many (standard) modelling notations have been extended with aspect-oriented mechanisms and advanced composition operators to support advanced separation of concerns, to combine (possibly heterogeneous) models modularizing different concerns, to execute an application based on modularized models, and to reason over global properties of modularized models.\nThe Second International Modularity in Modelling Workshop (MOMO) brings together researchers and practitioners interested in the theoretical and practical challenges resulting from applying modularity, advanced separation of concerns, and advanced composition at the modelling level. It is intended to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and discussing the impact of the use of modularization in the context of MDE at different levels of abstraction.\nExternal Website\nInformation about MOMO 2017 can be found on:http://www.momo2017.ece.mcgill.ca/",
