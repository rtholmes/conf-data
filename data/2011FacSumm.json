  "Abstract": "Even though computer vision remains one of the great unsolved Grand Challenges of computing, vision techniques are maturing at a rapid pace and finding their way into a large number of applications. Among these are natural user interfaces based on a visual understanding of scenes, actions, and three-dimensional data. \n\nIn this talk, I survey a number of computer vision technologies that were developed at Microsoft Research over the last decade, including:\n * Recognizing human poses and actions for range data (Kinect)\n * Segmenting and recognizing organs in three-dimensional (3-D) medical images \n * Stitching together dozens to hundreds of photographs for seamless navigation of panoramas, street side images, and 3-D object movies \n * Recognizing manufactured objects with your cell phone for quick comparison shopping \n\nI will also discuss some of the challenging open problems in our field."

  "Abstract": "Today, social software, which was initially embraced by youth who were interested in self-expression, meeting new people, and staying in touch with friends, influences a broad set of people—including traditional companies, governments, and people of all ages. It has changed the way people socialize online, making words such as: \"liking,\" \"friending,\" \"status,\" and \"tweeting\" commonplace. \n\nIn designing future social experience, we explore:\nWhere is social software trending? \nHow does research and innovation in this fast-paced area differ from other traditional areas in computer science? \nHow might we use lessons learned from social software to influence learning and education in the area of science and technology? \n\nWhat we see today, the Internet and social networks connecting people via status messaging, is just a beginning. It is our hope that social software can deliver in its promise to motivate people to action, improve the quality of life and social wellbeing, and help us solve meaningful problems and create amazing things together."

By tagging data with contextual markers, it delivers users what they want, when they want it without degrading opportunities to search for other data."

In-NEED addresses the humanitarian need of pre-emptive “survivor” systems/networks that engage and mobilize people within the community to act and share existing resources to mitigate the impact of natural disasters in the all-important hours directly preceding the event. By using existing technologies, localized platforms, and developing low-cost community nodes, In-NEED serves as a virtual survival kit."

  "Abstract": "It is well known that in many urban centers crime of any kind—but particularly those of a violent nature—are seldom reported. Porta Vox is a system that creates a community-reporting tool that helps track and reduce incidents of crime in urban areas. The belief is that by making the means of reporting present, simple, and connected, it can reduce the stigma and fear that is associated with reporting. The intended outcome is to reduce crime and the fear of crime, thus making cities eminently more livable."

  "Abstract": "The Tongji University project team of interdisciplinary students has focused on the growing trend of parents leaving behind their children in second and third tier cities for the large 1st tier cities in hopes of finding better economic opportunities. This trend is growing quickly, currently effecting more than 130 million parents and more than 50 million children who are now being raised by their grandparents. This separation between parent and children has a huge emotional impact and introduces some unique challenges of Chinese society today. The Apart – Together team has focused on a solution to improve the emotional bond between children and parents that are currently living in this situation."

  "Type": "Talk",

  "Authors": ["Ken Perlin"],
  "Affiliations": ["New York University"],
  "Abstract": "With their vast popularity and singular ability to engage young people, digital games have been hailed as a new paradigm for education in the 21st century. But researchers know surprisingly little about how successful games work. What are the key design elements that make certain games compelling, playable, and fun? How do game genres differ in their educational effectiveness for specific topics and for specific learners? How do kids learn when they play games? Does the setting (classroom vs. casual) matter? How can games be used to prepare future learning, introduce new material, or strengthen and expand existing knowledge? How are games designed to best facilitate the transfer of learning to everyday lives? And how can we use all of this knowledge to guide future game design? \n\nThe Games for Learning Institute (G4LI) seeks to answer these questions, pointing the way to a new era of game use in education, by applying a scientifically rigorous approach. Researchers study existing games, identify key design elements and learning patterns, develop prototype mini-games based on these elements and patterns, and evaluate them in classroom and informal learning settings. This talk will provide a peek inside how the G4LI does all this."

Medical data is particularly sensitive and privacy can have tremendous value in this space. Some recent projects and solutions focus on protecting patients’ privacy in several different ways, while maintaining the ability to use data flexibly for medical research and regional cost-saving efforts.

This session starts off with talks from three leaders in the area of Big Data, specifically a talk from OSD on how BING processes petabytes of data nightly, the failure rates and issues they encounter, followed by a talk from SQL Server outlining new information processing patterns emerging in how we extract insight from data closer to the actual source, and we close with a talk from an external researcher detailing efforts to build a data analytics appliance to support data intensive research. As host I will have prepared questions to ensure the final 30 minutes of discussion is lively/productive. ",

For computers to become more intelligent, we need to find ways to first produce knowledge in reliable and scalable manner, and then, to use that information to derive new knowledge. This comes with several challenges, acquisition bottleneck, and inference complexity. This Faculty Summit session will discuss these challenges and investigates answers via affinity groups created over the two sessions to get semantic knowledge close to a commodity computing resource. Session 1 explores steps to acquiring semantic knowledge at scale from terabytes of data, following approaches where training data have been successfully applied to several applications such as machine translation information extraction and question answering. These resources are contrasted with richer hand crafted knowledge sources. The discussion will explore the need for a hybrid approach making usage of automation and collective intelligence to bypass the acquisition bottleneck. ",

It has changed the way people socialize online, making words such as: \"liking,\" \"friending,\" \"status,\" and \"tweeting\" commonplace. \n\nIn designing future social experience, we explore:\nWhere is social software trending? \nHow does research and innovation in this fast-paced area differ from other traditional areas in computer science? \nHow might we use lessons learned from social software to influence learning and education in the area of science and technology? \n\nWhat we see today, the Internet and social networks connecting people via status messaging, is just a beginning. It is our hope that social software can deliver in its promise to motivate people to action, improve the quality of life and social wellbeing, and help us solve meaningful problems and create amazing things together.
