  "Authors": ["Lin Tan", "Yuanyuan Zhou", "Yoann Padioleau"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Waterloo, Canada", "UC San Diego, USA", "Facebook Inc., USA"],
  "Abstract": "Concurrency bugs in an operating system (OS) are detrimental as they can cause the OS to fail and affect all applications running on top of the OS. Detecting OS concurrency bugs is challenging due to the complexity of the OS synchronization, particularly with the presence of the OS speci&#64257;c interrupt context. Existing dynamic concurrency bug detection techniques are designed for user-level applications and cannot be applied to operating systems.\n\nTo detect OS concurrency bugs, we proposed a new type of annotations &#8211; interrupt related annotations &#8211; and generated 96,821 such annotations for the Linux kernel with little manual effort. These annotations have been used to automatically detect 9 real OS concurrency bugs (7 of which were previously unknown). Two of the key techniques that make the above contributions possible are: (1) using a hybrid approach to extract annotations from both code and comments written in natural language to achieve better coverage and accuracy in annotation extraction and bug detection; and (2) automatically propagating annotations to caller functions to improve annotating and bug detection. These two techniques are general and can be applied to non-OS code, code written in other programming languages such as Java, and for extracting other types of speci&#64257;cations."

  "Authors": ["Michael Bayne", "Richard Cook", "Michael D. Ernst"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Washington, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Developers who write code in a statically typed language are denied the ability to obtain dynamic feedback by executing their code during periods when it fails to type-check. They are further confined to the static typing discipline during times in the development process where it does not yield the highest productivity. If they opt instead to use a dynamic language, they forgo the many benefits of static typing. We present a novel approach to giving developers the benefits of both static and dynamic typing, throughout the development process, and without the burden of manually separating their program into statically- and dynamically-typed parts.\n\nOur approach relaxes the static type system and provides a semantics for many type-incorrect programs. We implemented our approach in a publicly available tool, DuctileJ, for the Java language. In case studies, DuctileJ conferred benefits both during prototyping and during the evolution of existing code."

  "Authors": ["Satish Chandra", "Emina Torlak", "Shaon Barman", "Rastislav Bodik"],
  "Affiliations": ["IBM Research, USA", "UC Berkeley, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Software ships with known bugs because it is expensive to pinpoint and &#64257;x the bug exposed by a failing test. To reduce the cost of bug identi&#64257;cation, we locate expressions that are likely causes of bugs and thus candidates for repair. Our symbolic method approximates an ideal approach to &#64257;xing bugs mechanically, which is to search the space of all edits to the program for one that repairs the failing test without breaking any passing test. We approximate the expensive ideal of exploring syntactic edits by instead computing the set of values whose substitution for the expression corrects the execution. We observe that an expression is a repair candidate if it can be replaced with a value that &#64257;xes a failing test and in each passing test, its value can be changed to another value without breaking the test. The latter condition makes the expression &#64258;exible in that it permits multiple values. The key observation is that the repair of a &#64258;exible expression is less likely to break a passing test. The method is called angelic debugging because the values are computed by angelically nondeterministic statements. We implemented the method on top of the Java PathFinder model checker. Our experiments with this technique show promise of its applicability in speeding up program debugging."

  "Authors": ["Rick Kazman", "Len Bass", "James Ivers", "Gabriel A. Moreno"],

  "Abstract": "This paper describes an analysis of some of the challenges facing one portion of the Smart Grid in the United States&#8212;residential Demand Response (DR) systems. The purposes of this paper are twofold: 1) to discover risks to residential DR systems and 2) to illustrate an architecture-based analysis approach to uncovering risks that span a collection of technical and social concerns. The results presented here are specific to residential DR but the approach is general and it could be applied to other systems within the Smart Grid and other critical infrastructure domains. Our architecture-based analysis is different from most other approaches to analyzing complex systems in that it addresses multiple quality attributes simultaneously (e.g., performance, reliability, security, modifiability, usability, etc.) and it considers the architecture of a complex system from a socio-technical perspective where the actions of the people in the system are as important, from an analysis perspective, as the physical and computational elements of the system. This analysis can be done early in a system&#8217;s lifetime, before substantial resources have been committed to its construction or procurement, and so it provides extremely cost-effective risk analysis."

In this paper, we present a novel approach that identi&#64257;es certain groups of code units that potentially share some cross-cutting concerns and recommends them for creating and updating aspects. Those code units, called concern peers, are detected based on their similar interactions (similar calling relations in similar contexts, either internally or externally). The recommendation is applicable to both the aspectization of non-aspect-oriented programs (i.e. for aspect creation), and the evolution of aspect-oriented programs (i.e. for aspect updating). The empirical evaluation on several real-world software systems shows that our approach is scalable and provides useful recommendations."

  "Authors": ["Pamela Bhattacharya", "Iulian Neamtiu"],
  "Affiliations": ["UC Riverside, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Billions of dollars are spent every year for building and maintaining software. To reduce these costs we must identify the key factors that lead to better software and more productive development. One such key factor, and the focus of our paper, is the choice of programming language. Existing studies that analyze the impact of choice of programming language suffer from several deficiencies with respect to methodology and the applications they consider. For example, they consider applications built by different teams in different languages, hence fail to control for developer competence, or they consider small-sized, infrequently-used, short-lived projects. We propose a novel methodology which controls for development process and developer competence, and quantifies how the choice of programming language impacts software quality and developer productivity. We conduct a study and statistical analysis on a set of long-lived, widely-used, open source projects---Firefox, Blender, VLC, and MySQL. The key novelties of our study are: (1) we only consider projects which have considerable portions of development in two languages, C and C++, and (2) a majority of developers in these projects contribute to both C and C++ code bases. We found that using C++ instead of C results in improved software quality and reduced maintenance effort, and that code bases are shifting from C to C++. Our methodology lays a solid foundation for future studies on comparative advantages of particular programming languages"

  "Authors": ["Ali Mesbah", "Mukul R. Prasad"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of British Columbia, Canada", "Fujitsu Laboratories of America, USA"],
  "Abstract": "With the advent of Web 2.0 applications and new browsers, the cross-browser compatibility issue is becoming increasingly important. Although the problem is widely recognized among web developers, no systematic approach to tackle it exists today. None of the current tools, which provide screenshots or emulation environments, speci&#64257;es any notion of cross-browser compatibility, much less check it automatically. In this paper, we pose the problem of cross-browser compatibility testing of modern web applications as a &#8216;functional consistency&#8217; check of web application behavior across di&#64256;erent web browsers and present an automated solution for it. Our approach consists of (1) automatically analyzing the given web application under di&#64256;erent browser environments and capturing the behavior as a &#64257;nite-state machine; (2) formally comparing the generated models for equivalence on a pairwise-basis and exposing any observed discrepancies. We validate our approach on several open-source and industrial case studies to demonstrate its e&#64256;ectiveness and real-world relevance."

  "Affiliations": ["TU Dortmund and Fraunhofer ISST, Germany"],
  "Abstract": "Developing security-critical software correctly and securely is di&#64259;cult. To address this problem, there has been a signi&#64257;cant amount of work over the last 10 years on providing model-based development approaches based on the Uni&#64257;ed Modeling Language which aim to raise the trustworthiness of security-critical systems, some of them including tools allowing the user to check whether a UML model satis&#64257;es the relevant security requirements. However, when the requirements are not satis&#64257;ed by a given model, it can be challenging for the user to determine which changes to do to the model so that it will indeed satisfy the security requirements. Also, the fact that software continues to evolve on an ongoing basis, even after the implementation has been shipped to the customer, increases the challenge since in principle, the software has to be re-veri&#64257;ed after each modi&#64257;cation, requiring signi&#64257;cant e&#64256;orts. We present work on automated tool-support that exploits recent work on secure software evolution in the Secure Change project in order to support the security hardening of evolving UML models (within the context of the UML security extension UMLsec)."

  "Key": "automated-usability-evaluation-parallel-programming-constructs",
  "Authors": ["Victor Pankratius"],
  "Affiliations": ["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],
  "Abstract": "Multicore computers are ubiquitous, and proposals to extend existing languages with parallel constructs mushroom. While everyone claims to make parallel programming easier and less error-prone, empirical language usability evaluations are rarely done in-the-&#64257;eld with many users and real programs. Key obstacles are costs and a lack of appropriate environments to gather enough data for representative conclusions. This paper discusses the idea of automating the usability evaluation of parallel language constructs by gathering subjective and objective data directly in every software engineer&#8217;s IDE. The paper presents an Eclipse prototype suite that can aggregate such data from potentially hundreds of thousands of programmers. Mismatch detection in subjective and objective feedback as well as construct usage mining can improve language design at an early stage, thus reducing the risk of developing and maintaining inappropriate constructs. New research directions arising from this idea are outlined for software repository mining, debugging, and software economics."

  "Authors": ["Giriprasad Sridhara", "Lori Pollock", "K. Vijay-Shanker"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Delaware, USA"],
  "Abstract": "One approach to easing program comprehension is to reduce the amount of code that a developer has to read. Describing the high level abstract algorithmic actions associated with code fragments using succint natural language phrases enables a newcomer to focus on fewer and more abstract concepts when trying to understand a given method. Unfortunately, such descriptions are typically missing because it is tedious to create manually.\n\nWe present an automatic technique for identifying code fragments that implement high level abstractions of actions and expressing these abstractions in a concise yet precise manner. Our studies of 1000 Java programs indicate that our heuristics for identifying code fragments implementing high level actions are widely applicable. Judgements of our generated descriptions by 15 experienced Java programmers strongly suggest that indeed they view the fragments that we identify as representing high level actions and our synthesized descriptions accurately express the abstraction."

In current testing practice and research, signi&#64257;cant effort and thought is placed on selecting test inputs, with the selection of test oracles largely neglected. Here, we argue that improvements to the testing process can be made by considering the problem of oracle selection. In particular, we argue that selecting the test oracle and test inputs together to complement one another may yield improvements testing effectiveness. We illustrate this using an example and present selected results from an ongoing study demonstrating the relationship between test suite selection, oracle selection, and fault &#64257;nding."

  "Authors": ["Nicolas Mangano", "Harold Ossher", "Ian Simmonds", "Matthew Callery", "Michael Desmond", "Sophia Krasikov"],
  "Affiliations": ["UC Irvine, USA", "IBM Research, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Tables are an important tool used by business analysts engaged in early requirements activities (in fact it is safe to say that tables appeal to many other types of user, in a variety of activities and domains). Business analysts typically use the tables provided by office tools. These tables offer great flexibility, but no underlying model, and hence no consistency management, multiple views or other advantages familiar to the users of modeling tools. Modeling tools, however, are usually too rigid for business analysts. In this paper we present a flexible modeling approach to tables, which combines the advantages of both office and modeling tools. Freeform information can co-exist with information managed by an underlying model, and an incremental formalization approach allows each item of information to transition fluidly between freeform and managed. As the model evolves, it is used to guide the user in the process of formalizing any remaining freeform information. The model therefore helps users without restricting them. Early feedback is described, and the approach is analyzed briefly in terms of cognitive dimensions."

This paper demonstrates the main features of the BQL infrastructure. We populated BQL with bugs collected from open-source projects and show that BQL could have helped users to fix real-world bugs."

  "Abstract": "Digital forensics investigations often consist of analyzing large quantities of data. The software tools used for analyzing such data are constantly evolved to cope with a multiplicity of versions and variants of data formats. This process of customization is time consuming and error prone.\n\nTo improve this situation we present DERRIC, a domain-specific language (DSL) for declaratively specifying data structures. This way, the specification of structure is separated from data processing. The resulting architecture encourages customization and facilitates reuse. It enables faster development through a division of labour between investigators and software engineers.\n\nWe have performed an initial evaluation of DERRIC by constructing a data recovery tool. This so-called carver has been automatically derived from a declarative description of the structure of JPEG files. We compare it to existing carvers, and show it to be in the same league both with respect to recovered evidence, and runtime performance."

  "Title": "Build System Maintenance",
  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "build-system-maintenance",
  "Authors": ["Shane McIntosh"],
  "Affiliations": ["Queen's University, Canada"],
  "Abstract": "The build system, i.e., the infrastructure that converts source code into deliverables, plays a critical role in the development of a software project. For example, developers rely upon the build system to test and run their source code changes. Without a working build system, development progress grinds to a halt, as the source code is rendered useless. Based on experiences reported by developers, we conjecture that build maintenance for large software systems is considerable, yet this maintenance is not well understood. A firm understanding of build maintenance is essential for project managers to allocate personnel and resources to build maintenance tasks effectively, and reduce the build maintenance overhead on regular development tasks, such as fixing defects and adding new features. In our work, we empirically study build maintenance in one proprietary and nine open source projects of different sizes and domain. Our case studies thus far show that: (1) similar to Lehman's first law of software evolution, build system specifications tend to grow unless effort is invested into restructuring them, (2) the build system accounts for up to 31% of the code files in a project, and (3) up to 27% of development tasks that change the source code also require build maintenance. Currently, we are working on identifying concrete measures that projects can take to reduce the build maintenance overhead."

  "Abstract": "This paper describes practical experience building and using pluggable type-checkers. A pluggable type-checker re&#64257;nes (strengthens) the built-in type system of a programming language. This permits programmers to detect and prevent, at compile time, defects that would otherwise have been manifested as run-time errors. The prevented defects may be generally applicable to all programs, such as null pointer dereferences. Or, an application-speci&#64257;c pluggable type system may be designed for a single application. We built a series of pluggable type checkers using the Checker Framework, and evaluated them on 2 million lines of code, &#64257;nding hundreds of bugs in the process. We also observed 28 &#64257;rst-year computer science students use a checker to eliminate null pointer errors in their course projects. Along with describing the checkers and characterizing the bugs we found, we report the insights we had throughout the process. Overall, we found that the type checkers were easy to write, easy for novices to productively use, and effective in &#64257;nding real bugs and verifying program properties, even for widely tested and used open source projects."

To address variability across a DRE domain, software product line concepts are used to categorize and organize the features and design patterns.

To address this issue, we present an approach for automatically anonymizing failure-inducing inputs that builds on a previously developed technique. Given an input I that causes a failure f, our approach generates an anonymized input I' that is different from I but still causes f. I' can thus be sent to developers to enable them to debug f without having to know I. We implemented our approach in a prototype tool, camouflage, and performed an extensive empirical evaluation where we applied camouflage to a large set of failure-inducing inputs for several real applications. The results of the evaluation are promising, as they show that camouflage is both practical and effective at generating anonymized inputs; for the inputs that we considered, I and I' shared no sensitive information. The results also show that our approach can outperform the general technique it extends."

Objective: We explore a new idea: utilizing the repertory grid technique to capture tacit architectural knowledge. Particularly, we investigate the elicitation of design decision alternatives and their characteristics. Method: To study the applicability of this idea, we performed an exploratory study. Seven independent subjects applied the repertory grid technique to document a design decision they had to take in previous projects. Then, we interviewed each subject to understand their perception about the technique. Results: We identified advantages and disadvantages of using the technique. The main advantage is the reasoning support it provides; the main disadvantage is the additional effort it requires. Also, applying the technique depends on the context of the project. Conclusion: Using the repertory grid technique is a promising approach for fighting architectural knowledge vaporization."

We analyzed 154 hazard reports and collected metrics to measure the prevalence of software in hazards and the specificity of descriptions of software causes of hazardous conditions. We found that 49-70% of 154 hazardous conditions could be caused by software or software was involved in the prevention of the hazardous condition. We also found that 12-17% of the 2013 hazard causes involved software, and that 23-29% of all causes had a software control.

In this study, we examine application crash, application hang, system crash, and usage information from millions of Windows&#174; users to 1) examine the effects of usage characteristics differences on field quality (e.g. which usage characteristics impact quality), 2) examine usage characteristics differences between beta and post-release (e.g. do impactful usage characteristics differ), and 3) report experiences adjusting field quality predictions for Windows. Among the 18 usage characteristics that we examined, the five most important were: the number of application executed, whether the machines was pre-installed by the original equipment manufacturer, two sub-populations (two language/geographic locales), and whether Windows was 64-bit (not 32-bit). We found each of these usage characteristics to differ between beta and post-release, and by adjusting for the differences, accuracy of field quality predictions for Windows improved by ~59%."

  "Abstract": "A process model, namely a formal definition of the coordination of agents performing activities using resources and artifacts, can aid understanding of the real-world process it models. Moreover, analysis of the model can suggest improvements to the real-world process. Complex real-world processes, however, exhibit considerable amounts of variation that can be difficult or impossible to represent with a single process model. Such processes can often be modeled better, within the restrictions of a given modeling notation, by a family of models. This paper presents an approach to the formal characterization of some of these process families. A variety of needs for process variation are identified, and suggestions are made about how to meet some of these needs using different approaches. Some mappings of different needs for variability to approaches for meeting them are presented as case studies."

  "Abstract": "Uncertain data processing is critical in a wide range of applications such as scienti&#64257;c computation handling data with inevitable errors and &#64257;nancial decision making relying on human provided parameters. While increasingly studied in the area of databases, uncertain data processing is often carried out by software, and thus software based solutions are attractive. In particular, Monte Carlo (MC) methods execute software with many samples from the uncertain inputs and observe the statistical behavior of the output. In this paper, we propose a technique to improve the cost-e&#64256;ectiveness of MC methods. Assuming only part of the input is uncertain, the certain part of the input always leads to the same execution across multiple sample runs. We remove such redundancy by coalescing multiple sample runs in a single run. In the coalesced run, the program operates on a vector of values if uncertainty is present and a single value otherwise. We handle cases where control &#64258;ow and pointers are uncertain. Our results show that we can speed up the execution time of 30 sample runs by an average factor of 2.3 without precision lost or by up to 3.4 with negligible precision lost."

A user faced with the task of analyzing this data, for example, to decide on test areas to improve, faces a 'needle in a haystack' problem.\n\nIn earlier studies we introduced substring hole analysis, a technique for presenting large quantities of coverage data in a succinct way. Here we demonstrate the successful use of substring hole analysis on large scale data from industrial software systems. For this end we augment substring hole analysis by introducing a work flow and tool support for practical code coverage analysis.\n\nWe conduct real data experiments indicating that augmented substring hole analysis enables code coverage analysis where it was previously impractical, correctly identifies functionality that is missing from existing tests, and can increase the probability of finding bugs. These facilitate cost-effective code coverage analysis."

  "Authors": ["Nicolas Lopez", "Andr&#233; van der Hoek"],

  "Abstract": "While code is typically presented as a flat file to a developer who must change it, this flat file exists within a context that can drastically influence how a developer approaches changing it. While the developer clearly must be careful changing any code, they probably should be yet more careful in changing code that recently saw major changes, is barely covered by test cases, and was the source of a number of bugs. Contextualized coding refers to the ability of the developer to effectively use such contextual information while they work on some changes. In this paper, we introduce the Code Orb, a contextualized coding tool that builds upon existing mining and analysis techniques to warn developers on a line-by-line basis of the volatility of the code they are working on. The key insight underneath the Code Orb is that it is neither desired nor possible to always present a code&#8217;s context in its entirety; instead, it is necessary to provide an abstracted view of the context that informs the developer of which parts of the code they need to pay more attention to. This paper discusses the principles of and rationale behind contextualized coding, introduces the Code Orb, and illustrates its function with example code and context drawn from the Mylyn project."

In this paper we describe an experimental approach that combines Regular Expression, Key Phrases, and Clustering with IR techniques to enhance the performance of IR for traceability link recovery between documents and source code. Our preliminary experimental results show that our combination technique improves the performance of IR, increases the precision of retrieved links, and recovers more true links than IR alone."

  "Abstract": "Numerous factors are involved when deciding when to implement which features in incremental software development. To facilitate a rational and e&#64259;cient planning process, release planning models make such factors explicit and compute release plan alternatives according to optimization principles. However, experience suggests that industrial use of such models is limited. To investigate the feasibility of model and tool support, we compared input factors assumed by release planning models with factors considered by expert planners. The former factors were cataloged by systematically surveying release planning models, while the latter were elicited through repertory grid interviews in three software organizations. The &#64257;ndings indicate a substantial overlap between the two approaches. However, a detailed analysis reveals that models focus on only select parts of a possibly larger space of relevant planning factors. Three concrete areas of mismatch were identi&#64257;ed: (1) continuously evolving requirements and speci&#64257;cations, (2) continuously changing prioritization criteria, and (3) authority-based decision processes. With these results in mind, models, tools and guidelines can be adjusted to address better real-life development processes."

Our analysis used data from 362 projects of four different firms. These projects spanned a wide range of programming languages, application domain, process choices, and development sites spread over 15 countries and 5 continents. Our analysis revealed fundamental tradeoffs in choosing configurational choices that are optimized for productivity, quality, and/or profits. In particular, achieving higher levels of productivity and quality require diametrically opposed configurational choices. In addition, creating imbalances in the expertise and personnel distribution of project teams significantly helps increase profit margins. However, a profitoriented imbalance could also significantly affect productivity and/or quality outcomes. Analyzing these complex tradeoffs, we provide actionable managerial insights that can help software firms and their clients choose configurations that achieve desired project outcomes in globally distributed software development."

  "Abstract": "Achieving high structural coverage is an important goal of software testing. Instead of manual producing tests that achieve high structural coverage, testers or developers can employ tools built based on automated test-generation approaches, such as Pex, to automatically generate such tests. Although these tools can easily generate tests that achieve high structural coverage for simple programs, when applied on complex programs in practice, these tools face various problems, such as the problems of dealing with method calls to external libraries or generating method-call sequences to produce desirable object states. Since these tools are currently not powerful enough to deal with these various problems in testing complex programs, we propose cooperative developer testing, where developers provide guidance to help tools achieve higher structural coverage. In this demo, we present Covana, a tool that precisely identi&#64257;es and reports problems that prevent Pex from achieving high structural coverage. Covana identi&#64257;es problems by determining whether branch statements containing not-covered branches have data dependencies on problem candidates."

  "Abstract": "Concurrent programs are notoriously difficult to test, and because of the often large number of thread schedules, testing all possible interleavings is practically infeasible. We propose a coverage-guided systematic testing framework where we use dynamically learned ordering constraints over shared object accesses to select only high-risk interleavings for test execution. An interleaving is of high-risk if it has not be covered by the ordering constraints, meaning that it has concurrency scenarios that have not been tested. Our method consists of two components. First, we utilize dynamic information collected from good test runs to learn ordering constraints over the memory-accessing and synchronization statements. Second, during systematic testing, we use the learned ordering constraints to guide the selection of interleavings for future testing. Our experiments show that the new method can increase the coverage of important concurrency scenarios with a reasonable cost and detect most of the concurrency bugs in practice."

  "Abstract": "Many software defect prediction models have been built using historical defect data obtained by mining software repositories (MSR). Recent studies have discovered that data so collected contain noises because current defect collection practices are based on optional bug fix keywords or bug report links in change logs. Automatically collected defect data based on the change logs could include noises. This paper proposes approaches to deal with the noise in defect data. First, we measure the impact of noise on defect prediction models and provide guidelines for acceptable noise level. We measure noise resistant ability of two well-known defect prediction algorithms and find that in general, for large defect datasets, adding FP (false positive) or FN (false negative) noises alone does not lead to substantial performance differences. However, the prediction performance decreases significantly when the dataset contains 20%-35% of both FP and FN noises. Second, we propose a noise detection and elimination algorithm to address this problem. Our empirical study shows that our algorithm can identify noisy instances with reasonable accuracy. In addition, after eliminating the noises using our algorithm, defect prediction accuracy is improved."

This is a challenge that needs to be addressed and it is our belief, and starting point of this thesis, that it is intrinsically related with the imperative programming style adopted by almost all available languages and with the approach adopted by engines, which limit themselves to executing orchestrations step-by-step. This obliges service architect to precisely specify every detail in the &#64258;ow among services, explicitly coding all the di&#64256;erent routes to go from the beginning to the end of the orchestration, forecasting all possible faults and exceptions that may happen at run-time. This results in a code which is hard to write and maintain, not to mention the impossibility of changing the expected &#64258;ow at run-time and the limited support to reusing part of pre-de&#64257;ned orchestrations. This thesis proposes a radically di&#64256;erent approach, which adopts a declarative, goal-oriented language to model service orchestrations, which is easier to use and results in more &#64258;exible compositions. At runtime, an ad-hoc engine interprets those models, using planning techniques to &#64257;nd a path to accomplish the orchestration goals, while providing powerful exception-handling mechanisms to cope with (un)expected situations, either re-building failed plans or allowing users to modify orchestration models at run-time, thus supporting the construction of highly-dynamic self-adaptative systems."

Our recommender system supports the relatively labor-intensive task of domain analysis, potentially increasing opportunities for re-use, reducing time-to-market, and delivering more competitive software products. The approach is empirically validated against 20 different product categories using thousands of product descriptions mined from a repository of free software applications."

We discuss how IBM designers and UX professionals used CogTool in their existing practice for contract compliance, communication within a product team and between a product team and its customer, assigning appropriate personnel to fix customer complaints, and quantitatively assessing design ideas before a line of code is written.

This work addresses this problem by: (1) identifying a family of architecturally-relevant code smells; (2) providing empirical evidence about the correlation of code smell patterns and architectural degeneration; (3) proposing a set of metrics and detection strategies and that exploit traceable architectural information in smell detection; and (4) conceiving a technique to support the early identification of architecture degeneration symptoms by reasoning about code smell patterns."

  "Abstract": "Literature indicates that 20% of a program&#8217;s code is responsible for 80% of the faults, and 50-90% of the field failures are rediscoveries of previous faults. Despite this, identification of faulty code can consume 30-40% time of error correction. Previous fault-discovery techniques focusing on field failures either require many pass-fail traces, discover only crashing failures, or identify faulty &#8220;files&#8221; (which are of large granularity) as origin of the source code. In our earlier work (the F007 approach), we identify faulty &#8220;functions&#8221; (which are of small granularity) in a field trace by using earlier resolved traces of the same release, which limits it to the known faulty functions. This paper overcomes this limitation by proposing a new &#8220;strategy&#8221; to identify new and old faulty functions using F007. This strategy uses failed traces of mutants (artificial faults) and failed traces of prior releases to identify faulty functions in the traces of succeeding release. Our results on two UNIX utilities (i.e., Flex and Gzip) show that faulty functions in the traces of the majority (60-85%) of failures of a new software release can be identified by reviewing only 20% of the code. If compared against prior techniques then this is a notable improvement in terms of contextual knowledge required and accuracy in the discovery of finer-grain fault origin."

We model the relative sociality of a developer as a ratio between the size of her communication network and the number of tasks she participates in. We obtain both measures from the problem tracking systems with her work-flow peer network representing her social learning, and the issues she has been working on representing her technical learning. Using three open source and three traditional projects we investigate how the initial project environment reflected by the sociality measure at the time a developer joins, affects her learning trajectory. In particular, the probability that a new developer will become one of long-term and productive developers is highest when the project sociality is low and there are significant differences between the social learning trajectories of the developers who join in low and in high sociality environments and between open source and commercial projects. These findings point out the importance of the initial environment in determining the future of the developers and may lead to better training and learning strategies in software organizations."

We claim that there is a need for methodologies, which capture requirements for scienti&#64257;c computing projects, because traditional requirements engineering methodologies are di&#64259;cult to apply in this domain. We propose a novel domain speci&#64257;c requirements model to meet this need. We conducted an exploratory experiment to evaluate the usage of this model in scienti&#64257;c computing projects. The results indicate that the proposed model facilitates the communication across the domain boundary, which is between the scienti&#64257;c computing domain and the software engineering domain. It supports requirements elicitation for the projects e&#64259;ciently."

  "Abstract": "Programs written in languages such as Java and C# maintain most of their state on the heap. The size and complexity of these programs pose a challenge in understanding and maintaining them; Heap analysis by summarizing the state of heap graphs assists programmers in these tasks. In this paper we present a novel dynamic heap analysis technique that uses spectra of the heap graphs to summarize them. These summaries capture the shape of recursive data structures as dynamic invariants or likely properties of these structures that must be preserved after any destructive update. Initial experiments show that this approach can generate meaningful summaries for a range of subject structures."

  "Abstract": "Software-defect detection is an increasingly important research topic in software engineering. To detect defects in a program, static veri&#64257;cation and dynamic test generation are two important proposed techniques. However, both of these techniques face their respective issues. Static veri&#64257;cation produces false positives, and on the other hand, dynamic test generation is often time consuming. To address the limitations of static veri&#64257;cation and dynamic test generation, we present an automated defect-detection tool, called DyTa, that combines both static veri&#64257;cation and dynamic test generation. DyTa consists of a static phase and a dynamic phase. The static phase detects potential defects with a static checker; the dynamic phase generates test inputs through dynamic symbolic execution to con&#64257;rm these potential defects. DyTa reduces the number of false positives compared to static veri&#64257;cation and performs more ef&#64257;ciently compared to dynamic test generation."

Using largely qualitative questionnaire and interview methods we investigate and document a range of technical, organizational and social factors that apparently influence organizational responses to MDE, specifically its perception as a successful or unsuccessful organizational intervention. We then outline a range of lessons learned. Whilst, as with all qualitative research, these lessons should be interpreted with care, they should also be seen as providing a greater understanding of MDE practice in industry, as well as the varied, and occasionally surprising, social, technical and organizational factors that affect success and failure. We conclude by suggesting how the next phase of the research will attempt to investigate some of these issues from a different angle and in greater depth."

  "Abstract": "It is widely believed that refactoring improves software quality and programmer productivity by making it easier to maintain and understand software systems. However, the role of refactorings has not been systematically investigated using &#64257;ne-grained evolution history. We quantitatively and qualitatively studied API-level refactorings and bug &#64257;xes in three large open source projects, totaling 26523 revisions of evolution.\n\nThe study found several surprising results: One, there is an increase in the number of bug &#64257;xes after API-level refactorings. Two, the time taken to &#64257;x bugs is shorter after API-level refactorings than before. Three, a large number of refactoring revisions include bug &#64257;xes at the same time or are related to later bug &#64257;x revisions. Four, API-level refactorings occur more frequently before than after major software releases. These results call for re-thinking refactoring&#8217;s true bene&#64257;ts. Furthermore, frequent &#64258;oss refactoring mistakes observed in this study call for new software engineering tools to support safe application of refactoring and behavior modifying edits together."

  "Abstract": "The build system of a software project is responsible for transforming source code and other development artifacts into executable programs and deliverables. Similar to source code, build system speci&#64257;cations require maintenance to cope with newly implemented features, changes to imported Application Program Interfaces (APIs), and source code restructuring. In this paper, we mine the version histories of one proprietary and nine open source projects of di&#64256;erent sizes and domain to analyze the overhead that build maintenance imposes on developers. We split our analysis into two dimensions: (1) Build Coupling, i.e., how frequently source code changes require build changes, and (2) Build Ownership, i.e., the proportion of developers responsible for build maintenance. Our results indicate that, despite the di&#64256;erence in scale, the build system churn rate is comparable to that of the source code, and build changes induce more relative churn on the build system than source code changes induce on the source code. Furthermore, build maintenance yields up to a 27% overhead on source code development and a 44% overhead on test development. Up to 79% of source code developers and 89% of test code developers are signi&#64257;cantly impacted by build maintenance, yet investment in build experts can reduce the proportion of impacted developers to 22% of source code developers and 24% of test code developers."

Analyzing the footprints of the operations &#8212; i.e., the part of a model actually used by an operation &#8212; is a simple technique to diagnose and analyze such problems. However, precisely calculating the footprint of an operation is expensive, because it requires analyzing the operation&#8217;s execution trace.\n\nIn this paper, we present an automated technique to estimate the footprint of an operation without executing it. We evaluate our approach by applying it to 75 models and &#64257;ve operations.

Evolve supports a model-driven approach in that architecture definition is used to directly construct both initial implementations and extensions to these implementations.

  "Abstract": "Often repositories of systems engineering artifacts at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) are so large and poorly structured that they have outgrown our capability to effectively manually process their contents to extract useful information. Sophisticated text mining methods and tools seem a quick, low-effort approach to automating our limited manual efforts. Our experiences of exploring such methods mainly in three areas including historical risk analysis, defect identification based on requirements analysis, and over-time analysis of system anomalies at JPL, have shown that obtaining useful results requires substantial unanticipated efforts - from preprocessing the data to transforming the output for practical applications. We have not observed any quick &#8220;wins&#8221; or realized benefit from short-term effort avoidance through automation in this area. Surprisingly we have realized a number of unexpected long-term benefits from the process of applying text mining to our repositories. This paper elaborates some of these benefits and our important lessons learned from the process of preparing and applying text mining to large unstructured system artifacts at JPL aiming to benefit future TM applications in similar problem domains and also in hope for being extended to broader areas of applications."

  "Abstract": "Feature-driven software development is a novel approach that has grown in popularity over the past decade. Researchers and practitioners alike have argued that numerous benefits could be garnered from adopting a feature-driven development approach. However, those persuasive arguments have not been matched with supporting empirical evidence. Moreover, developing software systems around features involves new technical and organizational elements that could have significant implications for outcomes such as software quality. This paper presents an empirical analysis of a large-scale project that implemented 1195 features in a software system. We examined the impact that technical attributes of product features, attributes of the feature teams and crossfeature interactions have on software integration failures. Our results show that technical factors such as the nature of component dependencies and organizational factors such as the geographic dispersion of the feature teams and the role of the feature owners had complementary impact suggesting their independent and important role in terms of software quality. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that cross-feature interactions, measured as the number of architectural dependencies between two product features, are a major driver of integration failures. The research and practical implications of our results are discussed."

  "Abstract": "Software product lines gain momentum in research and industry. Many product-line approaches use features as a central abstraction mechanism. Feature-oriented software development aims at encapsulating features in cohesive units to support program comprehension, variability, and reuse. Surprisingly, not much is known about the characteristics of cohesion in feature-oriented product lines, although proper cohesion is of special interest in product-line engineering due to its focus on variability and reuse. To &#64257;ll this gap, we conduct an exploratory study on forty software product lines of different sizes and domains. A distinguishing property of our approach is that we use both classic software measures and novel measures that are based on distances in clustering layouts, which can be used also for visual exploration of product-line architectures. This way, we can draw a holistic picture of feature cohesion. In our exploratory study, we found several interesting correlations (e.g., between development process and feature cohesion) and we discuss insights and perspectives of investigating feature cohesion (e.g., regarding feature interfaces and programming style)."

  "Authors": ["Stan Jarzabek", "Ha Duy Trung"],
  "Affiliations": ["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],
  "Abstract": "Developers tend to use models and generators during initial development, but often abandon them later in software evolution and reuse. One reason for that is that code generated from models (e.g., UML) is often manually modified, and changes cannot be easily propagated back to models. Once models become out of sync with code, any future re-generation of code overrides manual modifications. We propose a flexible generator solution that alleviates the above problem. The idea is to let developers weave arbitrary manual modifications into the generation process, rather than modify already generated code. A flexible generator stores specifications of manual modifications in executable form, so that weaving can be automatically re-done any time code is regenerated from modified models. In that way, models and manual modification can evolve independently but in sync with each other, and the generated code never gets directly changed. As a proof of concept, we have already built a flexible generator prototype by a merger of conventional generation system and variability technique to handle manual modifications. We believe a flexible generator approach alleviates an important problem that hinders wide spread adoption of MDD in software practice."

We present a framework for feedback-directed automated test generation for JavaScript in which execution is monitored to collect information that directs the test generator towards inputs that yield increased coverage. We implemented several instantiations of the framework, corresponding to variations on feedback-directed random testing, in a tool called Artemis. Experiments on a suite of JavaScript applications demonstrate that a simple instantiation of the framework that uses event handler registrations as feedback information produces surprisingly good coverage if enough tests are generated. However, by also using coverage information and read-write sets as feedback information, a slightly better level of coverage can be achieved, and sometimes with many fewer tests. The generated tests can be used for detecting HTML validity problems and other programming errors."

Bugzie considers a system to have multiple technical aspects, each is associated with technical terms. Then, it uses a fuzzy set to represent the developers who are capable/competent of fixing the bugs relevant to each term. The membership function of a developer in a fuzzy set is calculated via the terms extracted from the bug reports that (s)he has fixed, and the function is updated as new fixed reports are available. For a new bug report, its terms are extracted and corresponding fuzzy sets are union'ed. Potential fixers will be recommended based on their membership scores in the union'ed fuzzy set. Our preliminary results show that Bugzie achieves higher accuracy and efficiency than other state-of-the-art approaches."

GATE facilitates public testing in three main steps: 1) decompose the test criterion satisfaction problem into many smaller sub-model satisfaction problems; 2) construct games for each individual sub-models and presenting the games to the public through web servers; 3) collect and convert public users&#8217; action sequence data into real test cases which guarantee to cover not adequately tested elements. A preliminary study on apache-commons-math library shows that 44% of the branches have not been adequately tested by state of the art automatic test generation techniques. Among these branches, at least 42% are decomposable by GATE into smaller sub-problems. These elements naturally become the potential targets of GATE for public game-based testing."

We study the context in which experts are included in an email discussion so that team members can identify experts sooner. In this paper, we conduct a case study examining why people emerge in discussions by examining email within a distributed team. We find that people emerge in the following four situations: when a crisis occurs, when they respond to explicit requests, when they are forwarded in announcements, and when discussants follow up on a previous event such as a meeting. We observe that emergent people respond not only to situations where developers are seeking expertise, but also to execute routine tasks. Our findings have implications for expertise seeking and knowledge management processes."

  "Abstract": "Developers modify their systems by changing source code, updating test suites, and altering their system's execution context. When they make these modi cations, they have an understanding of the behavioural changes they expect to happen when the system is executed; when the system does not conform to their expectations, developers try to ensure their modi cation did not introduce some unexpected or undesirable behavioural change. We present an approach that integrates with existing continuous integration systems to help developers identify situations whereby their changes may have introduced unexpected behavioural consequences. In this research demonstration, we show how our approach can help developers identify and investigate unanticipated behavioural changes."

  "Abstract": "Developers evolve a software system by changing the program source code, by modifying its context by updating libraries or changing its configuration, and by improving its test suite. Any of these changes can cause differences in program behaviour. In general, program paths may appear or disappear between subsequent executions of a system. Some of these behavioural differences are expected by a developer; for example, executing new program paths is often precisely what is intended when adding a new test. Other behavioural differences may or may not be benign. For example, changing an XML configuration file may cause a previously-executed path to disappear, which may or may not be expected and could be problematic. Furthermore, the degree to which a behavioural change might be problematic may only become apparent over time as the new behaviour interacts with other changes.\n\nWe present an approach to identify specific program call dependencies where the programmer's changes to the program source code, its tests, or its environment are not apparent in the system's behaviour, or vice versa. Using a static and a dynamic call graph from each of two program versions, we partition dependencies based on their presence in each of the four graphs. Particular partitions contain dependencies that help a programmer develop insights about often subtle behavioural changes."

  "Abstract": "Following the design and in-lab testing of software, the evaluation of its resilience to actual operational perturbations in the field is a key validation need. Software-implemented fault injection (SWIFI) is a widely used approach for evaluating the robustness of software components. Recent research indicates that the selection of the applied fault model has considerable influence on the results of SWIFI-based evaluations, thereby raising the question how to select appropriate fault models (i.e. that provide justified robustness evidence).\n\nThis paper proposes several metrics for comparatively evaluating fault models's abilities to reveal robustness vulnerabilities. It demonstrates their application in the context of OS device drivers by investigating the influence (and relative utility) of four commonly used fault models, i.e. bit flips (in function parameters and in binaries), data type dependent parameter corruptions, and parameter fuzzing. We assess the efficiency of these models at detecting robustness vulnerabilities during the SWIFI evaluation of a real embedded operating system kernel and discuss application guidelines for our metrics alongside."

This research, inspired by the Impact Project, intends to investigate the technology transfer of software process simulation to the use in industrial settings, and further identify the best practices to release its full potential in software practice. We collected the reported applications of process simulation in software industry, and identi&#64257;ed its wide adoption in the organizations delivering various software intensive systems. This paper, as an initial report of the research, briefs a historical perspective of the impact upon practice based on the documented evidence, and also elaborates the research-practice transition by examining one detailed case study. It is shown that research has a signi&#64257;cant impact on practice in this area. The analysis of impact trace also reveals that the success of software process simulation in practice highly relies on the association with other software process techniques or practices and the close collaboration between researchers and practitioners."

We use a concept of essential use case interaction patterns to perform the correctness and completeness analysis on the semi-formal representation. We highlight potential inconsistencies, incompleteness and incorrectness using visual differencing in our support tool.

Quite many approaches exist for detecting inconsistencies. Only some of them provide solutions for repairing individual inconsistencies but none of them are able to investigate the repair problem comprehensively &#8211; in particular considering the side e&#64256;ects that might occur when applying a repair. My PhD thesis focuses on resolving inconsistencies, the different strategies one can follow and how to deal with the critical problem of side e&#64256;ects. My approach is based on an incremental approach for detecting inconsistencies and combines runtime analysis of the design rules&#8217; evaluation behavior with static analysis on the design rules&#8217; structure.

  "Abstract": "Systematic decision support for architectural design decisions is a major concern for software architects of evolving service-oriented systems. In practice, architects often analyse the expected performance and reliability of design alternatives based on prototypes or former experience. Modeldriven prediction methods claim to uncover the tradeo&#64256;s between di&#64256;erent alternatives quantitatively while being more cost-e&#64256;ective and less error-prone. However, they often suffer from weak tool support and focus on single quality attributes. Furthermore, there is limited evidence on their e&#64256;ectiveness based on documented industrial case studies. Thus, we have applied a novel, model-driven prediction method called Q-ImPrESS on a large-scale process control system consisting of several million lines of code from the automation domain to evaluate its evolution scenarios. This paper reports our experiences with the method and lessons learned. Bene&#64257;ts of Q-ImPrESS are the good architectural decision support and comprehensive tool framework, while one drawback is the time-consuming data collection."

Programs often manipulate partially-initialized objects, but they must do so with care. Furthermore, analyses must be aware of field initialization: proving the absence of null pointer dereferences or of division by zero, or proving that object invariants are satisfied, requires initialization information.\n\nWe present a static analysis that infers a safe over-approximation of the program elements that might hold raw objects. We have proved the analysis sound and implemented it in a tool called Julia. We have evaluated Julia on over 160K lines of code. We compared its output to manually-written initialization and nullness information, and to an independently-written type-checking tool that checks initialization and nullness. Julia's output is accurate and, we believe, useful both to programmers and to static analyses."

We present new, completely automatic inference techniques and a supporting tool, which take advantage of the presence of simple programmer-written contracts in the code to infer sophisticated assertions, involving for example implication and universal quanti&#64257;cation. Applied to a production library of classes covering standard data structures such as linked lists, arrays, stacks, queues and hash tables, the tool is able, entirely automatically, to infer 75% of the complete contracts&#8212;contracts yielding the full formal speci&#64257;cation of the classes&#8212;with very few redundant or irrelevant clauses."

The generated interfaces guarantee that the service composition ful&#64257;lls its requirements during the execution.

  "Abstract": "Locating the program element(s) relevant to a particular feature is an important step in efficient maintenance of a software system. The existing feature location techniques analyze each feature independently and perform a one-time analysis after being provided an initial input. As a result, these techniques are sensitive to the quality of the input, and they tend to miss the nonlocal interactions among features. In this paper, we propose to address the proceeding two issues in feature location using an iterative context-aware approach. The underlying intuition is that the features are not independent of each other, and the structure of source code resembles the structure of features. The distinguishing characteristics of the proposed approach are: 1) it takes into account the structural similarity between a feature and a program element to determine their relevance; 2) it employs an iterative process to propagate the relevance of the established mappings between a feature and a program element to the neighboring features and program elements. Our initial evaluation suggests the proposed approach is more robust and can significantly increase the recall of feature location with a slight decrease in precision."

Therefore, over the years many di&#64256;erent DSU approaches for Java have been proposed. Nevertheless, DSU for Java is still an active &#64257;eld of research, because most of the existing approaches are too restrictive. Some of the approaches have shortcomings either in terms of &#64258;exibility or performance, whereas others are platform dependent or dictate the program&#8217;s architecture.

Second, the framework can also be used to re-engineer a model from examples only, when an initial model is not available. We provide a preliminary evaluation of our framework by applying it to a Pump System case study, and integrate our prototype tool with the NuSMV model checker. We show how the tool integrates verification and evolution of abstract models, and also how it is capable of re-engineering partial models given examples from an existing system."

Mapping a software architecture to an implementation is a well known challenge. A key element of this mapping is the architecture's description of the data and control-flow interactions between components. The characterization of these interactions can be rather abstract or very concrete, providing more or less implementation guidance, programming support, and static verification.\n\nIn this paper, we explore one point in the design space between abstract and concrete component interaction specifications. We introduce a notion of behavioral contract that expresses the set of allowed interactions between components, describing both data and control-flow constraints. This declaration is part of the architecture description, allows generation of extensive programming support, and enables various verifications. We instantiate our approach in an architecture description language for the domain of Sense/Compute/Control applications, and describe associated compilation and verification strategies."

This represents an unconventional trade-off between, at one extreme, more ambitious analyses that attempt to discharge all conditions automatically (but which cannot even in principle handle environmental assumptions), and at the other, flow- or context-insensitive analyses that require more user involvement. The results of the analysis suggested a variety of ways in which dependability might be improved."

This framework uses statistical techniques to pinpoint load imbalance problems stemming from both control flow issues (e.g., unequal iteration counts) and interactions between the application and hardware (e.g., unequal cache miss rates). We evaluate LIME on applications from widely used parallel benchmark suites, and show that LIME accurately reports the causes of load imbalance, their nature and origin in the code, and their relative importance."

  "Abstract": "Matching logic is a new program verification logic, which builds upon operational semantics. Matching logic specifications are constrained symbolic program configurations, called patterns, which can be matched by concrete configurations. By building upon an operational semantics of the language and allowing specifications to directly refer to the structure of the configuration, matching logic has at least three benefits: (1) One's familiarity with the formalism reduces to one's familiarity with the operational semantics of the language, that is, with the language itself; (2) The verification process proceeds the same way as the program execution, making debugging failed proof attempts manageable because one can always see the \"current configuration\" and \"what went wrong\", same like in a debugger; and (3) Nothing is lost in translation, that is, there is no gap between the language itself and its verifier. Moreover, direct access to the structure of the configuration facilitates defining sub-patterns that one may reason about, such as disjoint lists or trees in the heap, as well as supporting framing in various components of the configuration at no additional costs."

In our exploratory study we propose a manual technique to locate documented security and legal problems in a set of reused software artifacts. We evaluate our technique with a case study of 81 Java libraries found in a proprietary e-commerce web application. Using our approach we discovered both a potential legal problem with one library, and a second library that was affected by a known security vulnerability. These results support our larger thesis: software reuse entails long-term maintenance costs. In future work we strive to develop automated techniques by which developers, managers, and other software stakeholders can measure, address, and minimize these costs over the lifetimes of their software assets."

  "Abstract": "Dynamic specification mining involves discovering software behavior from traces for the purpose of program comprehension and bug detection. However, in concurrent/distributed programs, the inherent partial order relationships among events occurring across processes pose a big challenge to specification mining. In this paper, we propose a framework for mining partial orders so as to understand concurrent program behavior. Our miner takes in a set of concurrent program traces, and produces a message sequence graph (MSG) to represent the concurrent program behavior. An MSG represents a graph where the nodes of the graph are partial orders, represented as Message Sequence Charts. Mining an MSG allows us to understand concurrent behaviors since the nodes of the MSG depict important ``phases\" or ``interaction snippets\" involving several concurrently executing processes. Experiments on mining behaviors of several fairly complex distributed systems show that our miner can produce the corresponding MSGs with both high precision and recall."

  "Abstract": "Specifications carrying formal parameters that are bound to concrete data at runtime can effectively and elegantly capture multi-object behaviors or protocols. Unfortunately, parametric specifications are not easy to formulate by non-experts and, consequently, are rarely available. This paper presents a general approach for mining parametric specifications from program executions, based on a strict separation of concerns: (1) a trace slicer first extracts sets of independent interactions from parametric execution traces; and (2) the resulting non-parametric trace slices are then passed to any conventional non-parametric property learner. The presented technique has been implemented in jMiner, which has been used to automatically mine many meaningful and non-trivial parametric properties of OpenJDK 6."

We model the software system using a two layers queuing model and use analytical techniques to &#64257;nd the workload mixes that change the bottlenecks in the system. Those workload mixes become stress vectors and initial starting points for the stress test cases. The rest of test cases are generated based on a feedback loop that drives the software system towards the worst case behaviour."

We introduce four related algorithms for model projection and prove each correct. We also present an empirical study of effectiveness and ef&#64257;ciency using ten models, including widely&#8211;studied benchmarks as well as industrial models. Results show that a typical projection includes about half of the states and a third of the transitions from the original model."

Currently researchers are utilizing timeseries analysis tools such as ARIMA to model these signals extracted from a project's VCS. Unfortunately current approaches are not very amenable to the underlying power-law distributions of this kind of signal. We propose modeling changes per time unit using multifractal analysis. This analysis can be used when a signal exhibits multiscale self-similarity, as in the case of complex data drawn from power-law distributions. Specifically we utilize multifractal analysis to demonstrate that software development is multifractal, that is the signal is a fractal composed of multiple fractal dimensions along a range of Hurst exponents. Thus we show that software development has multi-scale self-similarity, that software development is multifractal. We also pose questions that we hope multifractal analysis can answer."

We developed a tool-supported technique for detecting nonessential code differences in the revision histories of software systems. We used our technique to investigate code changes in over 24 000 change sets gathered from the change histories of seven long-lived open-source systems. We found that up to 15.5% of a system&#8217;s method updates were due solely to non-essential differences. We also report on numerous observations on the distribution of non-essential differences in change history and their potential impact on change-based analyses."

Understanding these factors, and properly deploying people resources can help managers improve quality outcomes. This paper considers the impact of code ownership and developer experience on software quality. In a large project, a &#64257;le might be entirely owned by a single developer, or worked on by many. Some previous research indicates that more developers working on a &#64257;le might lead to more defects. Prior research considered this phenomenon at the level of modules or &#64257;les, and thus does not tease apart and study the e&#64256;ect of contributions of di&#64256;erent developers to each module or &#64257;le. We exploit a modern version control system to examine this issue at a &#64257;ne-grained level. Using version history, we examine contributions to code fragments that are actually repaired to &#64257;x bugs. Are these code fragments &#8220;implicated&#8221; in bugs the result of contributions from many? or from one? Does experience matter? What type of experience? We &#64257;nd that implicated code is more strongly associated with a single developer&#8217;s contribution; our &#64257;ndings also indicate that an author&#8217;s specialized experience in the target &#64257;le is more important than general experience. Our &#64257;ndings suggest that quality control e&#64256;orts could be pro&#64257;tably targeted at changes made by single developers with limited prior experience on that &#64257;le."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Washington, USA"],
  "Abstract": "In object-oriented programs, a unit test often consists of a sequence of method calls that create and mutate objects. It is challenging to automatically generate sequences that are legal and behaviorally-diverse, that is, reaching as many different program states as possible. This paper proposes a combined static and dynamic test generation approach to address these problems, for code without a formal speci&#64257;cation. Our approach &#64257;rst uses dynamic analysis to infer a call sequence model from a sample execution, then uses static analysis to identify method dependence relations based on the &#64257;elds they may read or write. Finally, both the dynamicallyinferred model (which tends to be accurate but incomplete) and the statically-identi&#64257;ed dependence information (which tends to be conservative) guide a random test generator to create legal and behaviorally-diverse tests. Our Palus tool implements this approach. We compared it with a pure random approach, a dynamic-random approach (without a static phase), and a static-random approach (without a dynamic phase) on six popular open-source Java programs. Tests generated by Palus achieved 35% higher structural coverage on average. Palus is also internally used in Google, and has found 22 new bugs in four well-tested products."

Next, we compute vulnerability signatures that characterize all input strings that can exploit the discovered vulnerability. Given the vulnerability signatures, we then construct sanitization statements that 1) check if a given input matches the vulnerability signature and 2) modify the input in a minimal way so that the modi&#64257;ed input does not match the vulnerability signature. Our approach is capable of generating relational vulnerability signatures (and corresponding sanitization statements) for vulnerabilities that are due to more than one input."

Prior work has demonstrated the value of permissions for addressing many software engineering concerns, including information hiding, protocol checking, concurrency, security, and memory management. We propose the concept of a permission-based programming language--a language whose object model, type system, and runtime are all co-designed with permissions in mind. This approach supports an object model in which the structure of an object can change over time, a type system that tracks changing structure in addition to addressing the other concerns above, and a runtime system that can dynamically check permission assertions and leverage permissions to parallelize code. We sketch the design of the permission-based programming language Plaid, and argue that the approach may provide significant software engineering benefits."

The need to manage development efforts and resources in different locations increase the complexity and cost of modern day software development. Current software development environments do not provide suitable support to delegate task among teams with appropriate directives. TBDSD is also limited to the current internet capabilities. One of the resulting problems is the difficulty to delegate and control tasks assigned among remote teams. This paper proposes (1) a new framework for delegation in TBDSD, and (2) perspectives for deploying Process-centered Software Engineering Environments (PSEE) over the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) infrastructure. GENI, the &#8220;future Internet&#8221; that is taking shape in prototypes across the US, will allow, in the context of our study, to securely access and share software artifacts, resources, and tools as never before seen over the current Internet."

We have built Portfolio using a combination of models that address surfing behavior of programmer and sharing related concepts among functions. We conducted an experiment with 49 professional programmers to compare Portfolio to Google Code Search and Koders using a standard methodology. The results show with strong statistical significance that users find more relevant functions with higher precision with Portfolio than with Google Code Search and Koders."

However such approaches handle inconsistencies individually, assuming that each single inconsistency is a manifestation of an individual defect. We believe that inconsistencies are merely expressions of defects. That is, inconsistencies highlight situations under which defects are observable. However, a single defect in a software model may result in many inconsistencies and a single inconsistency may be the result of multiple defects. Inconsistencies may thus be related to other inconsistencies and we believe that during fixing, one should consider clusters of such related inconsistencies. This paper provides first evidence and emerging results that several inconsistencies can be linked to a single defect and show that with such knowledge only a subset of fixes need to be considered during inconsistency resolution."

Static program slicing is an attractive option for enabling routine change impact analysis for newly committed changesets during daily software build. For small programs with a few thousand lines of code, static program slicing scales well and can assist precise change impact analysis. However, as we demonstrate in this paper, static program slicing faces unique challenges when applied routinely on large and evolving industrial software systems. Despite recent advances in static program slicing, to our knowledge, there have been no studies of static change impact analysis applied on large and evolving industrial software systems. In this paper, we share our experiences in designing a static change impact analysis framework for such software systems.

  "Abstract": "Randomized algorithms have been used to successfully address many different types of software engineering problems. This type of algorithms employ a degree of randomness as part of their logic. Randomized algorithms are useful for difficult problems where a precise solution cannot be derived in a deterministic way within reasonable time. However, randomized algorithms produce different results on every run when applied to the same problem instance. It is hence important to assess the effectiveness of randomized algorithms by collecting data from a large enough number of runs. The use of rigorous statistical tests is then essential to provide support to the conclusions derived by analyzing such data. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of the use of randomized algorithms in selected software engineering venues in 2009. Its goal is not to perform a complete survey but to get a representative snapshot of current practice in software engineering research. We show that randomized algorithms are used in a significant percentage of papers but that, in most cases, randomness is not properly accounted for. This casts doubts on the validity of most empirical results assessing randomized algorithms. There are numerous statistical tests, based on different assumptions, and it is not always clear when and how to use these tests. We hence provide practical guidelines to support empirical research on randomized algorithms in software engineering."

Since tools are not powerful enough, the developers can provide guidance to help tools.

Instead of manually producing high-covering test inputs that achieve high structural coverage, testers or developers can employ tools built based on automated test-generation approaches to automatically generate such test inputs. Although these tools can easily generate high-covering test inputs for simple programs, when applied on complex programs in practice, these tools face various problems, such as the problems of dealing with method calls to external libraries, generating method-call sequences to produce desired object states, and exceeding defined boundaries of resources due to loops. Since these tools currently are not powerful enough to deal with these various problems in testing complex programs, we propose cooperative developer testing, where developers provide guidance to help tools achieve higher structural coverage. To reduce the efforts of developers in providing guidance to the tools, we propose a novel approach, called Covana. Covana precisely identifies and reports problems that prevent the tools from achieving high structural coverage primarily by determining whether branch statements containing not-covered branches have data dependencies on problem candidates."

The proposed addresses this problem by generating abstract behaviour models which resemble typestates. These models are statically computed and encode all admissible sequences of method calls. The level of abstraction at which such models are constructed has shown to be useful for validating code artefacts and identifying findings which led to the discovery of bugs, adjustment of the requirements expected by the engineer to the requirements implicit in the code, and the improvement of available documentation."

Specifically, we extend Gourlay's functional description of testing with the notion of a test oracle, an aspect of testing largely overlooked in previous foundational work and only lightly explored in general. We argue additional work exploring the interrelationship between programs, tests, and oracles should be performed, and use our extension to clarify concepts presented in previous work, present new concepts related to test oracles, and demonstrate that oracle selection must be considered when discussing the efficacy of a testing process."

  "Abstract": "Continuous quality assessment is crucial for the long-term success of evolving software. On the one hand, code analysis tools automatically supply quality indicators, but do not provide a complete overview of software quality. On the other hand, quality models de&#64257;ne abstract characteristics that in&#64258;uence quality, but are not operationalized. Currently, no tool chain exists that integrates code analysis tools with quality models. To alleviate this, the Quamoco project provides a tool chain to both de&#64257;ne and assess software quality. The tool chain consists of a quality model editor and an integration with the quality assessment toolkit ConQAT. Using the editor, we can de&#64257;ne quality models ranging from abstract characteristics down to operationalized measures. From the quality model, a ConQAT con&#64257;guration can be generated that can be used to automatically assess the quality of a software system."

  "Abstract": "Concurrency bugs, particularly data races, are notoriously difficult to debug and are a significant source of unreliability in multithreaded applications. Many tools to catch data races rely on program instrumentation to obtain memory instruction traces. Unfortunately, this instrumentation introduces significant runtime overhead, is extremely invasive, or has a limited domain of applicability making these tools unsuitable for many production systems. Consequently, these tools are typically used during application testing where many data races go undetected.\n\nThis paper proposes RACEZ, a novel race detection mechanism which uses a sampled memory trace collected by the hardware performance monitoring unit rather than invasive instrumentation. The approach introduces only a modest overhead making it usable in production environments. We validate RACEZ using two open source server applications and the PARSEC benchmarks. Our experiments show that RACEZ catches a set of known bugs with reasonable probability while introducing only 2.8% runtime slow down on average."

When this happens, some existing tests get broken because they no longer re&#64258;ect the intended behavior, and thus they need to be updated. Repairing broken tests can be time-consuming and di&#64259;cult. We present ReAssert, a tool that can automatically suggest repairs for broken unit tests. Examples include replacing literal values in tests, changing assertion methods, or replacing one assertion with several. Our experiments show that ReAssert can repair many common test failures and that its suggested repairs match developers&#8217; expectations."

To migrate a family of legacy software products into SPL for effective reuse, one has to understand commonality and variability among existing products variants. The existing techniques rely on manual identification and modeling of variability, and the analysis based on those techniques is performed at several mutually independent levels of abstraction. We propose a sandwich approach that consolidates feature knowledge from top-down domain analysis with bottom-up analysis of code similarities in subject software products. Our proposed method integrates model differencing, clone detection, and information retrieval techniques, which can provide a systematic means to reengineer the legacy software products into SPL based on automatic variability analysis."

  "Abstract": "Recent versions of the Java standard library offer flexible locking constructs that go beyond the language's built-in monitor locks in terms of features, and that can be fine-tuned to suit specific application scenarios. Under certain conditions, the use of these constructs can improve performance significantly, by reducing lock contention. However, the code transformations needed to convert between locking constructs are non-trivial, and great care must be taken to update lock usage throughout the program consistently. We present Relocker, an automated tool that assists programmers with refactoring synchronized blocks into ReentrantLocks and ReadWriteLocks, to make exploring the performance tradeoffs among these constructs easier. In experiments on a collection of real-world Java applications, Relocker was able to refactor over 80% of built-in monitors into ReentrantLocks. Additionally, in most cases the tool could automatically infer the same ReadWriteLock usage that programmers had previously introduced manually."

We have observed, however, that mashups tend to suffer from deficiencies that propagate through reuse. To address these deficiencies, we aim to bring some of the benefits of software engineering techniques to end users programming mashups. Here, we identify code smells indicative of deficiencies we observed in mashups programmed in the popular Yahoo! Pipes environment, and observe that end users generally prefer pipes that lack smells. We introduce refactorings that target those smells, reduce the mashup complexity, increase their abstraction, update broken data sources and dated components, and standardize their structures according to community development patterns. We shows that smells exist in 81% of a large sample of mashups and that refactorings reduce that number to 16%, illustrating the potential of refactoring to support the thousands of end users developing mashups."

By developing a tool that automatically refactors legacy code towards this pattern and by applying this tool to several programs, we have found not only that refactoring to role objects as currently defined produces code that is hard to read and to maintain, but also that the refactoring has preconditions so strong that it is rarely applicable in practice. We have therefore taken a fresh look at role objects and devised an alternative form that solves the exact same design problems, yet is much simpler to introduce and to maintain. We describe refactoring to this new, lightweight form of role objects in informal terms and report on the implementation of our refactoring tool for the JAVA programming language, presenting evidence of the refactoring&#8217;s increased applicability in several sample programs."

Even though these mechanisms widely vary in their notation and semantics, they all promote a shift in the way programs are structured. They promote expressive means to define the composition of two or more reusable modules. However, given the complexity of the composition code, its actual effects on software quality are not well understood. This PhD research aims at investigating the impact of emerging composition mechanisms on the simultaneous satisfaction of software reuse and maintainability. In order to perform this analysis, we intend to define a set of compositiondriven metrics and compare their efficacy with traditional modularity metrics. Finally, we plan to derive guidelines on how to use new composition mechanisms to maximize reuse and stability of software modules."

  "Abstract": "Unpredictable changes continuously affect software systems and may have a severe impact on their quality of service, potentially jeopardizing the system's ability to meet the desired requirements. Changes may occur in critical components of the system, clients' operational profiles, requirements, or deployment environments.\n\nThe adoption of software models and model checking techniques at run time may support automatic reasoning about such changes, detect harmful configurations, and potentially enable appropriate (self-)reactions. However, traditional model checking techniques and tools may not be simply applied as they are at run time, since they hardly meet the constraints imposed by on-the-fly analysis, in terms of execution time and memory occupation.\n\nThis paper precisely addresses this issue and focuses on reliability models, given in terms of Discrete Time Markov Chains, and probabilistic model checking. It develops a mathematical framework for run-time probabilistic model checking that, given a reliability model and a set of requirements, statically generates a set of expressions, which can be efficiently used at run-time to verify system requirements. An experimental comparison of our approach with existing probabilistic model checkers shows its practical applicability in run-time verification."

  "Authors": ["Shao Jie Zhang"],
  "Affiliations": ["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],
  "Abstract": "Concurrent data structures are widely used but notoriously difficult to implement correctly. Linearizability is one main correctness criterion of concurrent data structure algorithms. It guarantees that a concurrent data structure appears as a sequential one to users. Unfortunately, linearizability is challenging to verify since a subtle bug may only manifest in a small portion of numerous thread interleavings. Model checking is therefore a potential primary candidate. However, current approaches of model checking linearizability suffer from severe state space explosion problem and are thus restricted in handling few threads and/or operations. This paper describes a scalable, fully automatic and general linearizability checking method based on [16] by incorporating symmetry and partial order reduction techniques. Our insights emerged from the observation that the similarity of threads using concurrent data structures causes model checking to generate large redundant equivalent portions of the state space, and the loose coupling of threads causes it to explore lots of unnecessary transition execution orders. We prove that symmetry reduction and partial order reduction can be combined in our approach and integrate them into the model checking algorithm. We demonstrate its efficiency using a number of real-world concurrent data structure algorithms."

Second, they must select speci&#64257;c components from the relevant code to reuse. Third, they synthesize these components into their own software projects. Techniques exist to address speci&#64257;c instances of these three challenges, but these techniques do not support programmers throughout the reuse process.

  "Abstract": "Software development teams must be properly structured to provide effective collaboration to produce quality software. Over the last several years, social network analysis (SNA) has emerged as a popular method for studying the collaboration and organization of people working in large software development teams. Researchers have been modeling networks of developers based on socio-technical connections found in software development artifacts. Using these developer networks, researchers have proposed several SNA metrics that can predict software quality factors and describe the team structure. But do SNA metrics measure what they purport to measure? The objective of this research is to investigate if SNA metrics represent socio-technical relationships by examining if developer networks can be corroborated with developer perceptions. To measure developer perceptions, we developed an online survey that is personalized to each developer of a development team based on that developer&#8217;s SNA metrics. Developers answered questions about other members of the team, such as identifying their collaborators and the project experts. A total of 124 developers responded to our survey from three popular open source projects: the Linux kernel, the PHP programming language, and the Wireshark network protocol analyzer. Our results indicate that connections in the developer network are statistically associated with the collaborators whom the developers named. Our results substantiate that SNA metrics represent socio-technical relationships in open source development projects, while also clarifying how the developer network can be interpreted by researchers and practitioners."

  "Abstract": "We study the problem of model checking software product line (SPL) behaviours against temporal properties. This is more difficult than for single systems because an SPL with n features yields up to 2n individual systems to verify. As each individual verification suffers from state explosion, it is crucial to propose efficient formalisms and heuristics.\n\nWe recently proposed featured transition systems (FTS), a compact representation for SPL behaviour, and defined algorithms for model checking FTS against linear temporal properties. Although they showed to outperform individual system verifications, they still face a state explosion problem as they enumerate and visit system states one by one.\n\nIn this paper, we tackle this latter problem by using symbolic representations of the state space. This lead us to consider computation tree logic (CTL) which is supported by the industry-strength symbolic model checker NuSMV. We first lay the foundations for symbolic SPL model checking by defining a feature-oriented version of CTL and its dedicated algorithms. We then describe an implementation that adapts the NuSMV language and tool infrastructure. Finally, we propose theoretical and empirical evaluations of our results. The benchmarks show that for certain properties, our algorithm is over a hundred times faster than model checking each system with the standard algorithm."

Classical treatment of failures through strong fairness leads to a very high computational complexity and may be insu&#64259;cient for many interesting cases. We identify a realistic stronger fairness condition on the behaviour of failures. We show how to construct controllers satisfying liveness speci&#64257;cations under these fairness conditions. The resulting controllers exhibit the only possible behaviour in face of the given topology of failures: they keep retrying and never give up. We then identify some well-structure conditions on the environment. These conditions ensure that the resulting controller will be eager to satisfy its goals. Furthermore, for environments that satisfy these conditions and have an underlying probabilistic behaviour, the measure of traces that satisfy our fairness condition is 1, giving a characterisation of the kind of domains in which the approach is applicable."

  "Abstract": "Security experts use their knowledge to attempt attacks on an application in an exploratory and opportunistic way in a process known as penetration testing. However, building security into a product is the responsibility of the whole team, not just the security experts who are often only involved in the final phases of testing. Through the development of a black box security test plan, software testers who are not necessarily security experts can work proactively with the developers early in the software development lifecycle. The team can then establish how security will be evaluated such that the product can be designed and implemented with security in mind. The goal of this research is to improve the security of applications by introducing a methodology that uses the software system's requirements specification statements to systematically generate a set of black box security tests. We used our methodology on a public requirements specification to create 137 tests and executed these tests on five electronic health record systems. The tests revealed 253 successful attacks on these five systems, which are used to manage the clinical records for approximately 59 million patients, collectively. If non-expert testers can surface the more common vulnerabilities present in an application, security experts can attempt more devious, novel attacks."

  "Abstract": "Static program analyses and transformations for Java face many problems when analyzing programs that use re&#64258;ection or custom class loaders: How can a static analysis know which re&#64258;ective calls the program will execute? How can it get hold of classes that the program loads from remote locations or even generates on the &#64258;y? And if the analysis transforms classes, how can these classes be re-inserted into a program that uses custom class loaders? In this paper, we present TamiFlex, a tool chain that o&#64256;ers a partial but often e&#64256;ective solution to these problems. With TamiFlex, programmers can use existing staticanalysis tools to produce results that are sound at least with respect to a set of recorded program runs. TamiFlex inserts runtime checks into the program that warn the user in case the program executes re&#64258;ective calls that the analysis did not take into account. TamiFlex further allows programmers to re-insert o&#64260;ine-transformed classes into a program. We evaluate TamiFlex in two scenarios: benchmarking with the DaCapo benchmark suite and analysing large-scale interactive applications. For the latter, TamiFlex signi&#64257;cantly improves code coverage of the static analyses, while for the former our approach even appears complete: the inserted runtime checks issue no warning. Hence, for the &#64257;rst time, TamiFlex enables sound static whole-program analyses on DaCapo. During this process, TamiFlex usually incurs less than 10% runtime overhead."

  "Abstract": "Test coverage is about assessing the relevance of unit tests against the tested application. It is widely acknowledged that a software with a &#8220;good&#8221; test coverage is more robust against unanticipated execution, thus lowering the maintenance cost. However, insuring a coverage of a good quality is challenging, especially since most of the available test coverage tools do not discriminate software components that require a &#8220;strong&#8221; coverage from the components that require less attention from the unit tests. Hapao is an innovative test coverage tool, implemented in the Pharo Smalltalk programming language. It employs an e&#64256;ective and intuitive graphical representation to visually assess the quality of the coverage. A combination of appropriate metrics and relations visually shapes methods and classes, which indicates to the programmer whether more e&#64256;ort on testing is required. This paper presents the essence of Hapao using a real world case study."

  "Abstract": "Defects are unavoidable in software development and &#64257;xing them is costly and resource-intensive. To build defect pre- diction models, researchers have investigated a number of factors related to the defect-proneness of source code, such as code complexity, change complexity, or socio-technical factors. In this paper, we propose a new approach that emphasizes on technical concerns/functionality of a system. In our approach, a software system is viewed as a collection of software artifacts that describe di&#64256;erent technical concerns/aspects. Those concerns are assumed to have di&#64256;erent levels of defect-proneness, thus, cause di&#64256;erent levels of defect-proneness to the relevant software artifacts. We use topic modeling to measure the concerns in source code, and use them as the input for machine learning-based defect prediction models. Preliminary result on Eclipse JDT shows that the topic-based metrics have high correlation to the number of bugs (defect-proneness), and our topic-based defect prediction has better predictive performance than existing state-of-the-art approaches."

Examples include e-waste from computers made obsolete due to software upgrades, and changes in the power demands of new versions of software. Sustainable software engineering aims to create reliable, long-lasting software that meets the needs of users while reducing environmental impacts. We conducted three related research efforts to explore this area. First, we investigated the extent to which users thought about the environmental impact of their software usage. Second, we created a tool called GreenTracker, which measures the energy consumption of software in order to raise awareness about the environmental impact of software usage. Finally, we explored the indirect environmental effects of software in order to understand how software affects sustainability beyond its own power consumption. The relationship between environmental sustainability and software engineering is complex; understanding both direct and indirect effects is critical to helping humans live more sustainably."

Thus, there is a major challenge in retaining architectural information in a fast-faced agile project. We propose to embed as much architectural information as possible in the central artefact of the agile universe, the code. We argue that thereby valuable architectural information is retained for (automatic) documentation, validation, and further analysis, based on a relatively small investment of e&#64256;ort. We outline some preliminary examples of architectural annotations in Java and Python and their applicability in practice."

In a numerical example with a real incremental developmental project data, it is shown that the estimate of software reliability with a specific software reliability model can take a realistic value, and that the reliability growth phenomenon can be observed even in the incremental development scheme."

Without traceability support, it is easy for developers to inadvertently change critical architectural elements during ongoing system maintenance and evolution, leading to architectural erosion. Unfortunately, existing traceability practices, tend to result in the proliferation of traceability links, which can be difficult to create, maintain, and understand. We therefore present a decision-centric approach that focuses traceability links around the architectural decisions that have shaped the delivered system. Our approach, which is informed through an extensive investigation of architectural decisions made in real-world safety-critical and performance-critical applications, provides enhanced support for advanced software engineering tasks."

We further present a trace-retrieval approach that reverse engineers design decisions and their associated traceability links by training a classifier to recognize fragments of design decisions and then using the traceability patterns to reconstitute the decisions from their individual parts. traceability meta-models [2] for tracing ASRs can lead to the proliferation of a large number of unmanageable traceability links. This research presents a Decision-Centric Traceability (DCT) approach for tracing between ASRs and architectural components, and is designed to help developers ensure long-term integrity of the system-level qualities. In comparison to existing traceability meta-models [2], DCT reduces the number of traceability links and provides semantically rich traceability links that are used to support critical software engineering activities such as architectural preservation, impact analysis, and design visualization."

We design and implement TAEDS, a framework that focuses on gathering the data evolution history of a program at the runtime and provides a virtual machine for programmers to examine the behavior of data structures back in time. We show that our approach facilitates many programming tasks such as diagnosing memory problems and improving the design of the data structures themselves."

Immutable classes simplify programing because the programmer does not have to reason about side-e&#64256;ects. Sometimes programmers write immutable classes from scratch, other times they transform mutable into immutable classes. To transform a mutable class, programmers must &#64257;nd all methods that mutate its transitive state and all objects that can enter or escape the state of the class. The analyses are non-trivial and the rewriting is tedious. Fortunately, this can be automated.\n\nWe present an algorithm and a tool, Immutator, that enables the programmer to safely transform a mutable class into an immutable class. Two case studies and one controlled experiment show that Immutator is useful. It (i) reduces the burden of making classes immutable, (ii) is fast enough to be used interactively, and (iii) is much safer than manual transformations."

In contrast to industry, where reviews are typically assigned to specific individuals, changes are broadcast to thousands of potentially interested stakeholders. What is surprising is that this approach works very well, despite concerns that reviews may be ignored, or that discussions will deadlock because too many uninformed stakeholders are involved. In this paper, we describe an empirical study to investigate the mechanisms and behaviors that developers use to find code changes they are competent to review. We also explore how stakeholders interact with one another during the review process. We manually examine hundreds of reviews across five high profile OSS projects. Our findings provide insights into the simple, community-wide techniques that developers use to effectively manage large quantities of reviews. The themes that emerge from our study are validated by interviewing long-serving core developers."

By being able to mix imperative code with executable declarative speci&#64257;cations, the user can easily express constraint problems in place, i.e., in terms of the existing data structures and objects on the heap. After a solution is found, the heap is updated to re&#64258;ect the solution, so the user can continue to manipulate the program heap in the usual imperative way. We show that this approach is not only convenient, but, for certain problems can also outperform a standard imperative implementation. We also present an optimization technique that allowed us to run our tool on heaps with almost 2000 objects."

MATCON breaks down the method content, documents, templates, and work products into reusable objects, and enables them to be cataloged and indexed so these objects can be easily found and reused on subsequent projects. By using models and meta-modeling the reusable methods, we automatically produce a CASE tool to apply these methods, thereby guiding consultants through this complex process. The resulting tool helps consultants create the method deliverables for the initial phases of large customization projects.

  "Abstract": "Identifying similar or identical code fragments becomes much more challenging in code theft cases where plagiarizers can use various automated code transformation techniques to hide stolen code from being detected. Previous works in this &#64257;eld are largely limited in that (1) most of them cannot handle advanced obfuscation techniques; (2) the methods based on source code analysis are less practical since the source code of suspicious programs is typically not available until strong evidences are collected; and (3) those depending on the features of speci&#64257;c operating systems or programming languages have limited applicability. Based on an observation that some critical runtime values are hard to be replaced or eliminated by semanticspreserving transformation techniques, we introduce a novel approach to dynamic characterization of executable programs. Leveraging such invariant values, our technique is resilient to various control and data obfuscation techniques. We show how the values can be extracted and re&#64257;ned to expose the critical values and how we can apply this runtime property to help solve problems in software plagiarism detection. We have implemented a prototype with a dynamic taint analyzer atop a generic processor emulator. Our experimental results show that the value-based method successfully discriminates 34 plagiarisms obfuscated by SandMark, plagiarisms heavily obfuscated by KlassMaster, programs obfuscated by Thicket, and executables obfuscated by Loco/Diablo."

In the lazy approach, we generate all possible interleavings and call the SMT solver on each of them individually, until we either &#64257;nd a bug, or have systematically explored all interleavings. In the schedule recording approach, we encode all possible interleavings into one single formula and then exploit the high speed of the SMT solvers. In the underapproximation and widening approach, we reduce the state space by abstracting the number of interleavings from the proofs of unsatis&#64257;ability generated by the SMT solvers. In all three approaches, we bound the number of context switches allowed among threads in order to reduce the number of interleavings explored. We implemented these approaches in ESBMC, our SMT-based bounded model checker for ANSI-C programs. Our experiments show that ESBMC can analyze larger problems and substantially reduce the veri&#64257;cation time compared to stateof-the-art techniques that use iterative context-bounding algorithms or counter-example guided abstraction re&#64257;nement."

  "Abstract": "Photon propagation in biological tissue can be equivalently modeled with Monte Carlo simulations numerically or by the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) analytically. However, testing of a Monte Carlo program modeling photon propagation in biological tissue is difficult due to the unknown character of the test oracles. Although approaches based on Beer-Lambert law, van de Hulst&#8217;s table or RTE can be used for testing the Monte Carlo modeling program, these approaches are only applied to the program that is designed for homogeneous media. A rigorous way for testing the Monte Carlo modeling program for heterogeneous media is needed. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of the metamorphic testing approach to test a Monte Carlo modeling program for heterogeneous media. In addition, the metamorphic testing is extended with the evaluation of the adequacy of testing coverage criteria to measure the quality of the metamorphic testing, to guide the creation of metamorphic relations, to generate testing inputs, and to investigate the found exceptions. The effectiveness of the approach has been demonstrated through testing a Monte Carlo modeling program we developed for simulating photon propagation in human skins."

This article is intended as an attempt to breach the gap between academic model-based testing tools and their usage in industry. This is done by allowing the specification of a system in a widely accepted industry notation (UML state charts) and via a behind the scene transformation providing a formal representation of the system using the formal language LOTOS. As a byproduct of the transformation a formal semantics of UML state charts is given. An interesting class of software systems well suited for the application are distributed timed control oriented systems. As LOTOS contains no timing constructs, the timing information in the system is automatically abstracted by preserving the execution order of the timeout transitions."

  "Abstract": "In this paper, a new approach for analyzing program behavioral graphs to detect fault relevant paths is presented. The existing graph mining approaches for bug localization merely detect discriminative sub-graphs between failing and passing runs. However, they are not applicable when the context of a failure is not appeared in a discriminative pattern. In our proposed method, the suspicious transitions are identified by contrasting nearest neighbor failing and passing dynamic behavioral graphs. For finding similar failing and passing graphs, we first convert the graphs into adequate vectors. Then, a combination of Jacard-Cosine similarity measures is applied to identify the nearest graphs. The new scoring formula takes advantage of null hypothesis testing for ranking weighted transitions. The main advantage of the proposed technique is its scalability which makes it work on large and complex programs with huge number of predicates. Another main capability of our approach is providing the faulty paths constructed from fault suspicious transitions. Considering the weighted execution graphs in the analysis enables us to find those types of bugs which reveal themselves in specific number of transitions between two particular predicates. The experimental results on Siemens test suite and Space program manifest the effectiveness of the proposed method on weighted execution graphs for locating bugs in comparison with other methods."

This paper proposes a design of test agent model, including agents' knowledge, events, actions and interpreter. The knowledge represents the detected environment status, such as test results and changes in services under test. The action models testing behavior such as test configuration, test deployment and test schedule. The Interpreter defines the rules to select actions or parameters on certain events and conditions. In this way, given a set of knowledge at a certain time, a test agent dynamically adjusts its behavior according to its pre-defined rules and strategies. Case studies and experiments are exercised to apply the generic agent design to specific testing tasks such as performance testing and coverage-based testing."

  "Abstract": "More and more Web based systems are being developed by composing other single or even composite services. This is due to the fact that not all available services are able to satisfy the needs of a user. The process of composing Web services involves discovering the appropriate services, selecting the best services, combining those services together, and finally executing them. Although much research efforts have been dedicated to the discovery, selection, and composition of services, the process of testing the Web service composition has not been given the same attention. This paper discusses the importance of Web services composition testing, provides a classification of the most prominent approaches in that area, presents several criteria for comparison of those approaches, and conducts a comparative evaluation of the approaches. The results of the paper give an essential perspective to do research work on Web services composition testing."

The main focus of our paper is on providing techniques for automated test case generation relying on statistical usage models. Based on the open source software R for statistical computing and graphics the easy to handle test case generation and analyzing Testplayer tool was developped. Starting from customer-specific graphical Markov chain usage models test cases are automatically generated and visualized by highlighting selected nodes and arcs in the model. In addition, various metrics and corresponding diagrams offer analytical techniques to assess the quality of the derived test suite."

  "Abstract": "Assessing testing strategies and test sets is a crucial part of software testing. Mutation analysis is, among other approaches, a suitable technique for this purpose. However, compared with other methods it is rather time-consuming and applying mutation analysis to large software systems is still problematic. This paper presents a versatile approach, called conditional mutation, which increases the efficiency of mutation analysis. This new method significantly reduces the time overhead for generating and executing the mutants. Results are reported for eight investigated programs up to 373,000 lines of code and 406,000 generated mutants. Furthermore, conditional mutation has been integrated into the Java 6 Standard Edition compiler. Thus, it is widely applicable and not limited to a certain testing tool or framework."

  "Abstract": "Mutation testing is widely recognized as being extremely powerful, but is considered difficult to automate enough for practical use. This paper theoretically addresses two possible reasons for this: the generation of redundant mutants and the lack of integration of mutation analysis with other test criteria. By addressing these two issues, this paper brings an important mutation operator, relational-operator-replacement (ROR), closer to practical use. First, we develop fault hierarchies for the six relational operators, each of which generates seven mutants per clause. These hierarchies show that, for any given clause, only three mutants are necessary. This theoretical result can be integrated easily into mutation analysis tools, thereby eliminating generation of 57% of the ROR mutants. Second, we show how to bring the power of the ROR operator to the widely used Multiple Condition-Decision Coverage (MCDC) test criterion. This theoretical result includes an algorithm to transform any MCDC-adequate test set into a test set that also satisfies RORG, a new version of ROR appropriate for the MCDC context. The transformation does not use traditional mutation analysis, so can easily be integrated into existing MCDC tools and processes."

Over the past two years, with the aid of many of the world&#8217;s largest equipment vendors and operators, we have populated this database through extensive testing of industrial control devices. Delphi stores over 500 vulnerabilities on 31 popular distributed control system and safety instrumented system controllers. There are two primary reasons why Delphi data is useful: to distribute vulnerability data and to provide mitigation strategies. With detailed knowledge of which vulnerabilities are present, vendors can produce more robust devices and operators can construct business cases and calculate return-on-investment when considering investments in security measures. Furthermore, known vulnerabilities can be mitigated without applying device patches and shutting down plant operations."

  "Abstract": "Users increasingly rely on mobile applications for computational needs. Google Android is a popular mobile platform, hence the reliability of Android applications is becoming increasingly important. Many Android correctness issues, however, fall outside the scope of traditional verification techniques, as they are due to the novelty of the platform and its GUI-oriented application construction paradigm. In this paper we present an approach for automating the testing process for Android applications, with a focus on GUI bugs. We first conduct a bug mining study to understand the nature and frequency of bugs affecting Android applications; our study finds that GUI bugs are quite numerous. Next, we present techniques for detecting GUI bugs by automatic generation of test cases, feeding the application random events, instrumenting the VM, producing log/trace files and analyzing them post-run. We show how these techniques helped to re-discover existing bugs and find new bugs, and how they could be used to prevent certain bug categories. We believe our study and techniques have the potential to help developers increase the quality of Android applications."

Since the generated programs must compile, then we need to take into account syntax, scope rules, and type checking during our random generation. Doing so, while attaining a good distribution of test data, proves surprisingly subtle; the main contribution of this paper is a workable solution to this problem. We used it to generate typed functions on lists, which we compiled using the Glasgow Haskell compiler, a mature production quality Haskell compiler. After around 20,000 tests we triggered an optimiser failure, and automatically simplified it to a program with just a few constructs."

The validation infrastructure, i.e., radCHECK, is based on Property Editor. Such an editor simplifies the definition of PSL properties by exploiting PSL-based templates, that can be automatically compiled into executable checkers by using the integrated Checker Generator engine. Besides, radCHECK comprises a testcase generation infrastructure, i.e., Ulisse, which is based on an corner-case-oriented concolic approach for ESW, thus it is able to simulate the ESW and the checkers by using efficient testcases."

In spite of all the benefits of choreographies, the decentralized flow of information, the parallelism, and multiple party communication restrict the automated testing of choreographies at design and runtime. The goal of our research is to adapt the automated testing techniques used by the Agile Software Development community to the SOA context. To achieve that, we seek to develop software tools and a methodology to enable test-driven development of Choreographies. In this paper, we present our first step in that direction, a software prototype composed of ad hoc automated test case scripts for testing a web service choreography."

GUI testing tools---with their record-and-playback and data-driven capabilities---ease the pains of testing through automation. Out-of-the-box, however, these tools have some scaling limitations as setup costs are incurred for every distinct web application to test. In environments where a line of many web applications are regularly created for various customers and purposes, scaling the test automation to span the entire product line is extremely valuable. In this paper, we report on our experience in generalizing the automatic specification-based testing of input validation in a line of web applications. Our approach is based on a nonstandard use of a GUI testing tool enabled by adjustments to coding standards and the requirements specification writing process."

Unfortunately, addressing such feedback is not always straightforward, even when a team is fully invested in user-centered design. To investigate what constrains a teams evolution decisions, we performed a 6-month field study of a team employing iterative user-centered design methods to the design, deployment and evolution of a web application for a university community. Across interviews with the team, analyses of their bug reports, and further interviews with both users and non-adopters of the application, we found most of the constraints on addressing user feedback emerged from conflicts between users heterogeneous use of information and inflexible assumptions in the team&#8217;s software architecture derived from earlier user research. These findings highlight the need for new approaches to expressing and validating assumptions from user research as software evolves."

What defines a successful branching and merging strategy? As a first step towards answering these questions, we recruited a diverse sample of 140 version control users to participate in an online survey. In this paper, we present the survey results and 4 key observations about branching and merging practices in software development projects."

Agile methods, supported by the Agile Manifesto, defend the use of self-managing teams in software development in substitution of hierarchically managed, traditional teams. The goal of this research was to study how a self-managing software team works in practice and how the behaviors of the software organization support or hinder the effectiveness of such teams. We performed a single case holistic case study, looking in depth into the actual behavior of a mature Scrum team in industry. Using interviews and participant observation, we collected qualitative data from five team members in several interactions. We extract the behavior of the team and of the software company in terms of the determinants of self-managing team effectiveness defined in a theoretical model from the literature. We found evidence that 17 out of 24 determinants of this model exist in the studied context. We concluded that certain determinants can support or facilitate the adoption of methodologies like Scrum, while the use of Scrum may affect other determinants."

  "Abstract": "A common method of managing the complexity of both technical and organizational relationships in a large software project is to use branches within the source code management system to partition the work into teams and tasks. We claim that the files modified on a branch are changed together in a cohesive way to accomplish some task such as adding a feature, fixing a related set of bugs, or implementing a subsystem, which we collectively refer to as the goal of the branch. Further, the developers that work on a branch represent a virtual team. In this paper, we develop a theory of the relationship between goals and virtual teams on different branches. Due to expertise, ownership, and awareness concerns, we expect that if two branches have similar goals, they will also have similar virtual teams or be at risk for communication and coordination breakdowns with the accompanying negative effects. In contrast, we do not expect the converse to always be true. In the first step towards an actionable result, we have evaluated this theory empirically on two releases of the Windows operating system and found support in both."

Nowadays, software is often embedded in software ecosystems, i.e. in complex interrelations between different stakeholders who are connected by a shared technological platform. In our paper, we investigate how small software teams deal with the challenges of appropriating and configuring software in the Eclipse ecosystem for their daily work. We empirically identify three different approaches for dealing with appropriation in software ecosystems which are represented by the &#8220;ideal types&#8221; lone warrior, centralized organization, and collegial collaboration. Based on a discussion of these strategies and the underlying appropriation practices we found in the field, we suggest theoretical and practical implications for supporting appropriation in software ecosystems."

  "Abstract": "Software development teams are one of the most dynamic entities of any software development project. While the individuals are assigned planned roles at the start of any project, during the course of the project, the team constitution, structure, relationships and roles change. Such changes are often spontaneous and constitute the evolution of the team along different phases of the software development lifecycle. As software development is a team effort, these dynamics may have a significant effect on the development lifecycle itself. This work is aimed at studying the evolution of project teams and gathering insights that can be correlated with project health and outcomes. In this study we apply social network analysis techniques to investigate team evolution in a project in its testing phase. While the questions and insights that we investigate in this paper are valid and useful for all phases of the software development lifecycle, we have focused on software testing phase as it one of the most critical phases in the lifecycle. Our work aims to provide insights in the changes in team interactions and individual roles as the testing process continues and can help find if the same is aligned to the planned and desired project behavior."

  "Abstract": "A typical entry point for new developers in an open source project is to contribute a bug fix. However, finding an appropriate bug and an appropriate fix for that bug requires a good understanding of the project, which is nontrivial. Here, we extend Tesseract &#8211; an interactive project exploration environment &#8211; to allow new developers to search over bug descriptions in a project to quickly identify and explore bugs of interest and their related resources. More specifically, we extended Tesseract with search capabilities that enable synonyms and similar-bugs search over bug descriptions in a bug repository. The goal is to enable users to identify bugs of interest, resources related to that bug, (e.g., related files, contributing developers, communication records), and visually explore the appropriate socio-technical dependencies for the selected bug in an interactive manner. Here we present our search extension to Tesseract."

  "Abstract": "As software engineers collaboratively develop software, they need to often analyze past and present program modifications implemented by other developers. While several techniques focus on tool support for investigating past and present software modifications, do these techniques indeed address developers' awareness interests that are important to them? We conducted an initial focus group study and a web survey to understand in which task contexts and how often particular types of awareness-interests arise. Our preliminary study results indicate that developers have daily information needs about code changes that affect or interfere with their code, yet it is extremely challenging for them to identify relevant events out of a large number of change-events."

  "Abstract": "Software development in engineering firms is a prominent and vital activity, with the success of the business often being dependent on the tools being used. Developing this software requires collaboration between a number of stakeholders, including end-users and other software teams who are often remotely located. This research has used an ethnographic approach to studying communications between stakeholders involved in the development of this type of software. Findings show that users play a vital role in the development team due to their knowledge of the domain and work processes. Supporting this relationship remotely can be challenging, especially due to the reliance on ad-hoc communication strategies. This can sometimes lead to misunderstandings, design rationale being lost, and poor and efficient designs and processes. Lightweight tools that enable flexible design artefacts to be shared and discussed could assist this process and will be investigated in future work."

  "Abstract": "The success of a project is often affected by imperfect requirements. In order to cope with this risk, a requirements analyst needs to communicate with a client. However, communication between the requirements analyst and the client is not enough to prevent requirements imperfection, since requirements come from various sources, e.g. environment, laws, documents, actual usage, etc. The process of requirements elicitation is affected by the requirements stability, the ability of a requirements analyst, and accessibility of the source of requirements. This paper focuses on the distance between the source of requirements and a requirements analyst, and clarifies how the distance influences the requirements maturation. Requirements maturation represents the degree to which the requirements are elicited completely. We define a measure for observing requirements maturation and analyzing the accessibility of the source of the requirements. Then, we define a hypothesis. A case is analyzed in order to verify the hypothesis. As a result, there is a correlation between the requirements maturation efficiency and the accessibility of the source of the requirements."

In this context, the purpose of this paper is to explore in what extent the experience with DSD can improve the performance of software development professionals, even in collocated environments. Data was collected based on the evaluation of a DSD teaching experience in a course taught in Brazil. The preliminary results indicate that experiences lived in a distributed context could help software engineers to become better practitioners."

These GCs are typically very difficult problems that will take many hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of man-years to solve. Researchers involved in identifying these problems are not going to solve them. That task will fall to our students, and our students' students. Unfortunately for GC6, the Grand Challenge focusing on Dependable Systems Evolution, interest in formal methods--both by students and within computer science faculties--falls every year and any mention of mathematics in the classroom seems to frighten students away. So the question is: How do we attract new students in computing to the area of dependable software systems? \nOver the past several years at three universities we have experimented with the use of computer games as a target domain for software engineering project courses that focus on reliable systems engineering. This position paper summarizes our experiences in incorporating rigorous software engineering into courses with computer game projects."

Here we advocate a layered Statechart-based AI as a modular approach that simplifies reuse. We analyze Statechart interactions and communications with respect to AI design, and propose an interface for Statechart-based AI-modules that summarizes interactions. \nReuse is accomplished by adding and removing modules to a new AI, largely enabled through event-renaming to ensure coherence with the interfaces. We describe an approach to module composition using functional groups, which allow for the encapsulation of high level behaviours (e.g., fleeing or exploring). This enables a designer to compose new AIs by assigning high-level behaviours. Additionally, the interface describes interactions with the game at-large, leading naturally to portability between games and even implementation languages. Finally, we look ahead to the requirements for a tool that would implement these ideas."

We propose an approach to software engineering called HALO that builds upon the properties found in popular games, by turning work into a game environment. Our proposed approach can be viewed as a model for a family of prospective games that would support the software development process. Utilizing operant conditioning and flow theory, we create an immersive software development environment conducive to increased productivity.

We believe that combining elements of social interaction with exercise in video games will lead to increased and sustained engagement in physical activity. In this paper, we present an initial design of GameChanger, a middleware to support the development of a new generation of social exergames that interweave physical activity as a core game mechanic with social elements such as competition and collaboration. The GameChanger middleware provides programming abstractions that are specific to social exergame mechanics, elevating their description so that even non-expert programmers can create interesting social exergames that utilize mobile phones and sensing technology to integrate physical activity into gameplay. In addition, the middleware provides constructs for performing continuous assessment of physical activity during gameplay; these constructs can be used to provide feedback to the gameplayer or to collect datasets for evaluation by health researchers. As such, the GameChanger middleware can also serve as a platform to support scientific experimentation and exploration to determine which combinations of social and physical elements have the greatest impact on physical activity."

Those who do not have access to the educational courses miss the learning context, even if educational tools are accessible for free. Computer game design has been employed as an engaging medium for practicing software engineering and computer programming skills. However, collaborative work is not supported by educational game design environments and peer learning is limited to face-to-face communication in the classroom. In this paper, we suggest democratizing computer science education by incorporating social learning into the educational game design using existing Web 2.0 mechanisms. Consequently, online users will benefit from situated learning in the game design activities that take place in their social networking space.

Gone is the central server that coordinates all activities and manages evolution of the game state; gone is perfect communication among all players at all times; and gone are specialized sensors and controllers purpose built for games.

  "Abstract": "Scientific programmers strive constantly to meet performance demands. Tuning is often done manually, despite the significant development time and effort required. One example is lookup table (LUT) optimization, a technique that is generally applied by hand due to a lack of methodology and tools. LUT methods reduce execution time by replacing computations with memory accesses to precomputed tables of results. LUT optimizations improve performance when the memory access is faster than the original computation, and the level of reuse is sufficient to amortize LUT initialization. Current practice requires programmers to inspect program source to identify candidate expressions, then develop specific LUT code for each optimization. Measurement of LUT accuracy is usually ad hoc, and the interaction with multicore parallelization has not been explored. \nIn this paper we present Mesa, a standalone tool that implements error analysis and code generation to improve the process of LUT optimization. We evaluate Mesa on a multicore system using a molecular biology application and other scientific expressions. Our LUT optimizations realize a performance improvement of 5X for the application and up to 45X for the expressions, while tightly controlling error. We also show that the serial optimization is just as effective on a parallel version of the application. Our research provides a methodology and tool for incorporating LUT optimizations into existing scientific code."

While it was possible to construct static schedules manually for simple, single-core systems, the increase in complexity introduced by multi-core processors and the demand for flexible and dynamic engineering processes in the avionics domain, require a novel approach for their automatic generation. \nThis paper describes ongoing trends in the avionics domain to further underline engineering constraints encountered, when introducing multi-core processors in a safety critical area. By focussing on the requirement of a predictable behavior, a model-based approach for the generation of static schedules for complex multi-core systems is presented. It incorporates the usage of external resources, which is essential to achieve deterministic resource access and real-time behavior on hardware architectures with multiple execution units."

By varying the target PDL descriptor, code for different target configurations can be generated without the need to modify the input program. We utilize a simple task-based programming model for demonstration of our approach and present preliminary results indicating its applicability on a state-of-the-art heterogeneous system."

  "Abstract": "SkePU is a C++ template library that provides a simple and unified interface for specifying data-parallel computations with the help of skeletons on GPUs using CUDA and OpenCL. The interface is also general enough to support other architectures, and SkePU implements both a sequential CPU and a parallel OpenMP backend. It also supports multi-GPU systems. Currently available skeletons in SkePU include map, reduce, mapreduce, map-with-overlap, map-array, and scan. The performance of SkePU generated code is comparable to that of hand-written code, even for more complex applications such as ODE solving. \nIn this paper, we discuss initial results from auto-tuning SkePU using an off-line, machine learning approach where we adapt skeletons to a given platform using training data. The prediction mechanism at execution time uses off-line pre-calculated estimates to construct an execution plan for any desired configuration with minimal overhead. The prediction mechanism accurately predicts execution time for repetitive executions and includes a mechanism to predict execution time for user functions of different complexity. The tuning framework covers selection between different backends as well as choosing optimal parameter values for the selected backend. We will discuss our approach and initial results obtained for different skeletons (map, mapreduce, reduce)."

We explore how this framework can be extended to implement lightweight parallel accumulators that allow multiple threads to Store sample data, and support concurrent GetResult operations that incrementally compute desired functions over the data. Our evaluation shows that our parallel accumulators are scalable and can effectively exploit programmer-supplied knowledge to achieve signi&#64257;cant optimizations for some important cases."

  "Abstract": "Writing multi-threaded shared variable code is notoriously difficult because a given program can result in different possible executions due to non-determinism. Observed executions may also vary depending on the specific compiler and runtime system at hand. Many aspects of behavior are beyond the control of the programmer at the language's level of abstraction (e.g., compiler transformations), and as a result, debugging and performance tuning are very difficult tasks. In this position paper, we propose that the language implementation stack (compiler, runtime system) should be open, i.e., transparent, accountable, and interactive, so that the programmer may have direct access to invaluable information, and regain control over the behavior of the program in a given environment."

  "Abstract": "In the multi-core era, programmers need to resort to parallelism if they want to improve program performance. Thus, a major maintenance task will be to make sequential programs more concurrent. Must concurrency be designed into a program, or can it be retrofitted later? What are the most common transformations to retrofit concurrency into sequential programs? Are these transformations random, or do they belong to certain categories? How can we automate these transformations? \nTo answer these questions we analyzed the source code of 5 open-source Java projects and looked at a total of 14 versions. We analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively the concurrency-related transformations. We found that these transformations belong to four categories: transformations that improve the responsiveness, the throughput, the scalability, or correctness of the applications. In 73.9% of these transformations, concurrency was retrofitted on existing program elements. In 20.5% of the transformations, concurrency was designed into new program elements. Our findings educate software developers on how to parallelize sequential programs, and provide hints for tool vendors about what transformations are worth automating."

Structural clones are recurring configurations of simple clones (i.e., similar code fragments). In this paper, we show how structural clone analysis extends the benefits of analysis based on simple clones only. First, we present experimental results showing that in many cases simple clones participated in structural clones. In such cases, structural clones being larger than simple clones but smaller in number, allow analysts to see the &#8220;forest from the trees&#8221;, as far as the similarity situation is concerned. We provide arguments and examples to show how the knowledge of structural clones &#8211; their location and exact similarities and differences &#8211; helps in program understanding, design recovery, maintenance, and refactoring."

Our research group has supported many software developers with the code clone detection tool CCFinder and its GUI front-end Gemini. Gemini shows clone sets (i.e., a set of code clones identical or similar to each other) with several clone metrics including their length and the number of code clones; however, it is not clear how to use those metrics to extract interesting code clones for developers. In this paper, we propose a method combining clone metrics to extract code clones for refactoring activity. We have conducted an empirical study on a web application developed by a Japanese software company. The result indicates that combinations of simple clone metric is more effective to extract refactoring candidates in detected code clones than individual clone metric."

  "Abstract": "It is still a debated question whether cloned code causes increased maintenance efforts. If cloned code is more stable than non-cloned code, i.e. it is changed less often, it will require less maintenance efforts. The more stable cloned code is, the longer it will not have been changed, so the stability can be estimated through the code's age. This paper presents a study on the average age of cloned code. For three large open source systems, the age of every line of source code is computed as the date of the last change in that line. In addition, every line is categorized whether it belongs to cloned code as detected by a clone detector. The study shows that on average, cloned code is older than non-cloned code. Moreover, if a file has cloned code, the average age of the cloned code of the file is lower than the average age of the non-cloned code in the same file. The results support the previous findings that cloned code is more stable than non-cloned code."

  "Abstract": "There are several tools and techniques developed over the past decade for detecting duplicated code in software. However, there exists a class of languages for which clone detection is ill-suited. We discovered one of these languages when we attempted to use clone detection to find similar web service operations in service descriptions written in the Web Service Description Language (WSDL). WSDL is structured in such a way that identifying units for comparison becomes a challenge. WSDL service descriptions contain specifications of one or more operations that are divided into pieces and intermingled throughout the description. In this paper, we describe a method of reorganizing them in order to leverage clone detection technology to identify similar services. We introduce the idea of contextual clones &#8211; clones that can only be found by augmenting code fragments with related information referenced by the fragment to give it context. We demonstrate this idea for WSDL and propose other languages and situations for which contextual clones may be of interest."

  "Abstract": "The semantic web is slowly transforming the web as we know it into a machine understandable pool of information that can be consumed and reasoned about by various clients. Source-code is no exception to this trend and various communities have proposed standards to share code as linked data. With the availability of large amounts of open source code published in publically accessible repositories and the introduction of massively horizontally scaling frameworks and cloud computing infrastructure, a new era of software mining across information silos is reshaping the software engineering landscape. The so far unreachable goal of analyzing code at a global level, and therefore detecting global software clones, has become manageable. Description logic and semantic web reasoners have so far only plaid a minor role in this transformation and are mainly used to model source code data. In this paper, we introduce a clone detection algorithm that uses a semantic web reasoner and is based on the Hadoop map-reduce framework that can scale horizontally to a large amount of data. We also define a novel and compact clone model that only considers control-blocks and used data types while still yielding similar clone detection results than more complex representations. In order to validate our approach we have compared our algorithm to some of the leading clone detection tools (CCFinder, JCD and Simian) and show differences in performance and detection precision."

Manually evaluating a group of such clones requires observing each clone in its original location (i.e., opening each file and finding the source location of each clone), which can be a time-consuming process. As an alternative, this paper introduces a new technique to localize the representation of code clones to provide a summary of the properties of two or more clones in one location. In our approach, the results of a clone detection tool are analyzed in an automated manner to determine the properties (i.e., similarities and differences) of the clones. These properties are visualized directly within the source editor. The localized representation is realized as part of the features of an Eclipse plug-in called CeDAR."

We argue that determining the origin of software artifacts is an increasingly important problem with many dimensions.

  "Abstract": "Software development projects are difficult to manage, in general, due to the friction between completing system features and, at the same time, obtaining a high degree of code quality to ensure maintainability of the system in the future. A major challenge of this optimization problem is that code quality is less visible to stakeholders in the development process, particularly, to the management. In this paper, we describe an approach for automated software analysis and monitoring of both quality-related code metrics and development activities by means of software maps. A software map represents an adaptive, hierarchical representation of software implementation artifacts such as source code files being organized in a modular hierarchy. The maps can express and combine information about software development, software quality, and system dynamics; they can systematically be specified, automatically generated, and organized by templates. The maps aim at supporting decision-making processes. For example, they facilitate to decide where in the code an increase of quality would be beneficial both for speeding up current development activities and for reducing risks of future maintenance problems. Due to their high degree of expressiveness and their instantaneous generation, the maps additionally serve as up-to-date information tools, bridging an essential information gap between management and development, improve awareness, and serve as early risk detection instrument. The software map concept and its tool implementation are evaluated by means of two case studies on large industrially developed software systems."

  "Abstract": "Technical debt is a metaphor describing situations where developers accept sacrifices in one dimension of development (e.g. software quality) in order to optimize another dimension (e.g. implementing necessary features before a deadline). Approaches, such as code smell detection, have been developed to identify particular kinds of debt, e.g. design debt. What has not yet been understood is the impact design debt has on the quality of a software product. Answering this question is important for understanding how growing debt affects a software product and how it slows down development, e.g. though introducing rework such as fixing bugs. In this case study we investigate how design debt, in the form of god classes, affects the maintainability and correctness of software products by studying two sample applications of a small-size software development company. The results show that god classes are changed more often and contain more defects than non-god classes. This result complements findings of earlier research and suggests that technical debt has a negative impact on software quality, and should therefore be identified and managed closely in the development process."

Much of the research on technical debt has focused on decisions made by project architects and individual developers who choose to trade off short-term gain for a longer-term cost. However, in the context of enterprise software development, such a model may be too narrow. We explore the premise that technical debt within the enterprise should be viewed as a tool similar to financial leverage, allowing the organization to incur debt to pursue options that it couldn&#8217;t otherwise afford. We test this premise by interviewing a set of experienced architects to understand how decisions to acquire technical debt are made within an enterprise, and to what extent the acquisition of technical debt provides leverage. We find that in many cases, the decision to acquire technical debt is not made by technical architects, but rather by non-technical stakeholders who cause the project to acquire new technical debt or discover existing technical debt that wasn&#8217;t previously visible. We conclude with some preliminary observations and recommendations for organizations to better manage technical debt in the presence of some enterprise-scale circumstances."

  "Abstract": "Technical debt is the technical work developers owe a system, typically caused by speeding up development, e.g. before a software release. Approaches, such as code smell detection, have been developed to identify particular kinds of debt, e.g. design debt. Up until now, code smell detection has been used to help point to components that need to be freed from debt by refactoring. To date, a number of methods have been described for finding code smells in a system. However, typical debt properties, such as the value of the debt and interest rate to be paid, have not been well established. This position paper proposes an approach to using cost/benefit analysis to prioritize technical debt reduction work by ranking the value and interest of design debt caused by god classes. The method is based on metric analysis and software repository mining and is demonstrated on a commercial software application at a mid size development company. The results are promising: the method helps to identify which refactoring activities should be performed first because they are likely to be cheap to make yet have significant effect, and which refactorings should be postponed due to high cost and low payoff."

  "Abstract": "The concept of technical debt provides an excellent tool for describing technology gaps in terms any stakeholder can understand. The technical debt metaphor was pioneered by the software development community and describes technical challenges in that context wonderfully. However, establishing a definitional framework which describes issues affecting quality more broadly will better align to stakeholder perspectives. Building on the existing concept in this way will enable technology stakeholders by providing a centralized technical debt model. The metaphor can then be used to consistently describe quality challenges anywhere within the technical environment. This paper lays the foundation for this conceptual model by proposing a definitional framework that describes how technology gaps affect all aspects of quality."

The idea of our approach is to use Twitter as a platform for collaborations of human and software services in the context of workflows. We introduce primitives that provide SOA functionality like service discovery or service binding and illustrate how these primitives are embedded in Tweets. By using Tweets, we are able to reuse existing infrastructures and tools (e.g., twitter clients on mo- bile devices) for the communication between services and humans. Simultaneously, we exploit social network structures originating from Twitter follower networks in order to discover (human and software) resources that are required for the execution of a workflow. Finally, we are able to monitor the execution of workflows with Twitter, simply by following Tweets that represent the execution of a workflow."

  "Abstract": "Increasingly, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is becoming a dominant mechanism for the consumption of software by end users. From a vendor&#8217;s perspective, the benefits of SaaS arise from leveraging economies of scale, by serving a large number of customers (&#8220;tenants&#8221;) through a shared instance of a centrally hosted software service. Consequently, a SaaS provider would, in general, try to drive commonality amongst the requirements of different tenants, and at best, offer a fixed set of customization options. However, many tenants would also come with custom requirements, which may be a pre-requisite for them to adopt the SaaS system. These requirements should then be addressed by evolving the SaaS system in a controlled manner, while still supporting the needs of existing tenants. This need to balance tenant variability and commonality, and to optimize on development and testing effort, can make the evolution of multi-tenant SaaS systems an interesting engineering challenge; this has strong economic undertones as well, given the &#8220;pay-per-use&#8221; subscription model of SaaS, and the cost of incremental development and maintenance to cater to new tenant needs. In this paper, we outline a set of research issues in the design, testing and maintenance of multi-tenant SaaS systems, and highlight some of the interesting optimization questions that arise in the process. Presenting specific technical solutions is beyond the scope of this paper &#8211; instead, our goal is to help shape a research agenda for multi-tenant SaaS that can provide stimulus for further investigation into this area by the software and service engineering research community."

  "Abstract": "We address the problem of interface-based test coverage for Web services. We suggest an approach to analyze the Application Programming Interface (API) of Web services, calculate the number of possible input combinations and compare it to the number of actual historical invocations. Such API coverage metrics are an indicator to which extent the service has been used. Measuring API coverage is a key concern for assessing the significance of Verification and Validation (V&V) techniques; on the other hand, API coverage metrics can also yield interesting usage reports for a service-based system in production use. The coverage metrics rely on the exact specification of service interfaces, and we provide a mechanism to specify restrictions for data types in the Java Web services framework (JAX-WS). As full enumeration of all possible inputs is often infeasible, we allow the definition of custom coverage metrics by means of domain partitioning: the user divides domain ranges into subsets, and a coverage of 100% means that the logged invocations contain at least one sample for each subset. Based on a prototype implementation, we evaluate different aspects of our approach."

  "Abstract": "Service-oriented systems live in an open world, one in which their functionality and quality of service depend on how the services they interact with evolve. System adaptation has been indicated as a way to cope with the evolution these partner services may have. When a partner does not behave as expected, in an adaptable system we can substitute it with an alternative compatible one. Finding a compatible alternative, however, is a difficult task if we consider conversational services that impose a specific interaction protocol and specific data-types. In this paper we introduce Interaction Sequence Charts (ISC) as an effective notation for describing the interactions a service has with its partners, and an algorithm that uses these charts to establish a &#8220;degree of compatibility&#8221; between interacting services. The algorithm considers both interaction protocol requirements and data-type similarity, for which fuzzy techniques are adopted. The expressive power of ISC is validated by using it to describe the complex behaviour that can be defined using BPEL 2.0, while the algorithm is validated on an example in the field of Tele-Radiology, and shown to be advantageous in practice."

  "Abstract": "Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for Software Services aim to clearly identify the service level commitments established between service requesters and providers. A dynamic configuration for the monitoring of these SLAs provides the opportunity for service monitor providers to offer and release monitoring infrastructures for different types of services. Whilst there has been work on automating this monitor matching and configuration, additional support may be needed in the negotiation and provision of monitors for which the current monitoring infrastructure does not provide suitable SLA term monitors. In this paper we describe an approach to effectively report and assist service monitoring support groups in managing this provision. The approach described is illustrated with mechanical support in the form of a SMaRT Workbench Eclipse IDE plug-in for reporting on the monitorability of SLAs for service monitoring infrastructures."

A service-based software system is a multilayered system that includes the web service (WS), shared resources, and the hosting application server (AS). It is conjectured that the reliability prediction of the web services is improved if the reliability model accounts for such underlying layers. The initial experiment illustrates that the AS and shared resources can impact the overall reliability of web services greatly. This observation is demonstrated by simulating the interaction between a web service and the AS."

  "Abstract": "Need for adaptiveness of business applications is on the rise with continued increase in business dynamics. Ground-up development techniques neither deliver nor can scale in this dynamic situation. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) aims to increase adaptiveness by capturing commonality and variability up front to suitably configure the application from its parts. Code-centric SPLE techniques show unacceptable responsiveness when business applications are subjected to changes along multiple simultaneously evolving dimensions. Using clear separation of functional concerns from implementation platform, model driven approaches enable easy delivery of the same functionality into multiple technology platforms. However, business applications exhibit variability in several dimensions such as functionality, business process, design decisions, architecture, and technology platform. We argue that SPLE techniques need to be elevated to a higher level of abstraction to enable them to work in unison with model-driven techniques in order to realize the desired adaptiveness along all these dimensions. We have been delivering large business applications using model-driven techniques for past 15 years. In this paper, we have outlined several key challenges that we faced in adopting SPLE and presented tenets of a solution that is likely to have greater acceptance by industry practice."

Integration of SPLs often implies the reuse of a previously-implemented feature across other SPLs. The reuse of a SPL feature is only viable if the underlying programming mechanisms enable its smooth composition within the code of other SPLs. If the required modifications are significant, the design of the target SPLs are likely to be destabilized. This paper presents an exploratory study on the integration of three product lines from the board game domain. We investigate how aspect-oriented and feature-oriented programming impact on the reuse and stability of those product lines."

Among these challenges, possibly the most important one is the porting of applications to the heterogeneous devices available on the market. This requires mobile developers to create and maintain several versions of their applications in order to deal with particular features of each platform, including display size, development libraries, sensors, keypad layout, etc. The Software Product Lines (SPL) approach seems to be an useful technique to support mobile application development. A way to make SPL more effective is automating the software components composition for building mobile applications. We present a software infrastructure called AppSpotter that enables the dynamic and automated composition of software components of mobile applications taking into account the particular features of each mobile device. By means of the devices features, AppSpotter determines the components selection and composition of them to build customized mobile applications."

We address these issues with a prototype version control system that is designed to support product line engineering, but without imposing a strong process model.

It supports evolution of core assets and of products, as well as propagation of changes from core assets to products and vice versa."

To provide a graphical user interface for the physicists to interact with we selected the Groovy programming language and the Grails web framework. To construct the software we followed the Scrum agile software development methodology. This paper will report on the motivation and risks of such an undertaking. It will also report on the suitability of Eucalyptus as a cloud framework and the utility of the tools used to build an application on top of it."

  "Abstract": "Virtual Computing Lab is a higher education cloud computing environment that on demand, allocates a chosen software stack on the required hardware and gives access to the customers, in this case NCSU students, faculty and staff. VCL has been in operation since 2004. An important component of the quality of the services provided by a cloud is the reliability and availability. For example, typical availability of the system exceeds 0.999, and reservation reliability is in the 0.99 range. VCL provides comprehensive information (provenance, logs, etc.) about its execution, its resources, and its performance. We mined the VCL log files to find out more about its reliability and availability, and the character of its faults and failures. This paper presents some of these results."

  "Abstract": "Cloud computing is changing the way applications are being developed, deployed and managed. Application developers can focus on business and functionality and leverage infrastructure clouds (IaaS) to provide them low cost resources (e.g., computation, storage, and networking) that can be controlled based on application needs. However, current IaaS cloud developers have to deal with daunting tasks to configure and deploy their applications in different cloud providers. This paper presents the Uni4Cloud approach that facilitates to model, deploy and configure complex applications in multiple infrastructure clouds. We demonstrate through an enterprise application case study how Uni4Cloud facilitates to deploy components (e.g., application server, database, load balancer) in multiple clouds using a model-based approach that helps to automatically configure and deploy applications independent of IaaS cloud provider. Moreover, the approach is based on cloud computing standards such as the Open Virtualization Format (OVF) and Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) to favor interoperability and to avoid being locked in to specific cloud providers."

  "Abstract": "Cloud computing has attracted attention as an important platform for software deployment, with perceived benefits such as elasticity to fluctuating load, and reduced operational costs compared to running in enterprise data centers. While some software is written from scratch specially for the cloud, many organizations also wish to migrate existing applications to a cloud platform. Such a migration exercise to a cloud platform is not easy: some changes need to be made to deal with differences in software environment, such as programming model and data storage APIs, as well as varying performance qualities. We report here on experiences in doing a number of sample migrations. We propose a taxonomy of the migration tasks involved, and we show the breakdown of costs among categories of task, for a case-study which migrated a .NET n-tier application to run on Windows Azure. We also indicate important factors that impact on the cost of various migration tasks. This work contributes towards our future direction of building a framework for cost-benefit trade-off analysis that would apply to migrating applications to cloud platforms, and could help decision-makers evaluate proposals for using cloud computing."

We describe the steps of the proposed process and exemplify the use of the methodology through an example. The methodology can be used by small to large scale organisations to inform crucial decisions related to cloud adoption."

  "Abstract": "The proposed NASA Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice (DESDynI) mission would be a first-of-breed endeavor that would fundamentally change the paradigm by which Earth Science data systems at NASA are built. DESDynI is evaluating a distributed architecture where expert science nodes around the country all engage in some form of mission processing and data archiving. This is compared to the traditional NASA Earth Science missions where the science processing is typically centralized. What's more, DESDynI is poised to profoundly increase the amount of data collection and processing well into the 5 terabyte/day and tens of thousands of job range, both of which comprise a tremendous challenge to DESDynI's proposed distributed data system architecture. In this paper, we report on a set of architectural trade studies and benchmarks meant to inform the DESDynI mission and the broader community of the impacts of these unprecedented requirements. In particular, we evaluate the benefits of cloud computing and its integration with our existing NASA ground data system software called Apache Object Oriented Data Technology (OODT). The preliminary conclusions of our study suggest that the use of the cloud and OODT together synergistically form an effective, efficient and extensible combination that could meet the challenges of NASA science missions requiring DESDynI-like data collection and processing volumes at reduced costs."

  "Abstract": "The climate research community is increasingly interested in utilizing direct, observational measurements to validate model output in an effort to tune those models to better approximate our planet&#8217;s dynamic climate. The current emphasis on performing these comparisons at regional, as opposed to global, scales presents challenges both scientific and technical, since regional ecosystems are highly heterogeneous and the available data is not readily consumed on a regional basis. If provided with a common approach for efficiently accessing and utilizing the existing observational datasets, climate researchers have the potential to effect lasting societal, economic and political benefits. A key challenge, however, is that model-to-observational comparison requires massive quantities of data and significant computational capabilities. Further complicating matters is the fact that, currently, observational data and model outputs exist in a variety of data formats, utilize varying degrees of specificity and resolution, and reside in disparate, highly heterogeneous data systems. In this paper we present a soft- ware architectural approach that leverages the advantages of cloud computing and modern open-source software technologies to address the regional climate modeling problem. Our system, dubbed RCMES, is highly scalable and elastic, allows for both local and distributed management of the satellite observations and generated model outputs, and delivers this information to climate researchers in a way that is easily integrated into existing climate simulations and statistical tools."

  "Abstract": "MapReduce is promising for developing both scalable business and scientific data intensive applications. However, there are few existing scientific workflow systems which can benefit from the MapReduce programming model. We propose a workflow system for integrating structure, and orchestrating MapReduce jobs for scientific data intensive workflows. The system consists of a simple workflow design C++ API, a job scheduler, and a runtime support system for Hadoop or Sector/Sphere frameworks. A climate satellite data intensive processing and analysis application is developed as a use case and an evaluation for the workflow system. The evaluation shows that it is possible to make the steps in the climate data intensive application automatically from data gridding to complex data analysis using the workflow system. The performance of the climate analysis application is significantly improved by the enabled MapReduce workflow system compared with the sequential embarrassing parallel methods. The overhead of the workflow system is negligible. However, the graphic user interface is still under development for the workflow system."

  "Abstract": "The nature of scientific research and the development of scientific software have similarities with processes that follow the agile manifesto: responsiveness to change and collaboration are of the utmost importance. But how well do current scientific software development processes match the practices found in agile development methods, and what are the effects of using agile practices in such processes? In order to investigate this, we conduct a literature review, focusing on evaluating the agility present in a selection of scientific software projects. Both projects with intentionally agile practices and projects with a certain degree of agile elements are taken into consideration. In the agility assessment, we define and utilize an agile mapping chart. The elements of the mapping chart are based on Scrum and XP, thus covering two of the most prominent agile reference models. We compared the findings of the literature review to results of a previously conducted survey. The comparison indicates that scientific software development projects adopting agile practices perceive their testing to be better than average. No difference to average projects was perceived regarding requirements-related activities. Future work includes an in-depth case study to further investigate the existence and impact of agility in three large scientific software projects, ultimately aiming at a better understanding of the particularities involved in developing scientific software."

At the same time, CSE research organizations find it difficult to prescribe formal SE practices for funded projects. \nTheoretical and experimental science rely heavily on independent verification of results as part of the scientific process. Computational science should have the same regard for independent verification but it does not. \nIn this paper, we present an argument for using reproducibility and independent verification requirements as a driver to improve SE processes and practices. We describe existing efforts that support our argument, how these requirements can impact SE, challenges we face, and new opportunities for using reproducibility requirements as a driver for higher quality CSE software."

  "Abstract": "Modern scientific enterprises are inherently knowledge-intensive. In general, scientific studies in domains such as geosciences, climate, and biology require the acquisition and manipulation of large amounts of experimental and field data in order to create inputs for large-scale computational simulations. The results of these simulations must then be analyzed, leading to refinements of inputs and models and additional simulations. Further, these results must be managed and archived to provide justifications for regulatory decisions and publications that are based on these models. In this paper we introduce our Velo framework that is designed as a reusable, domain independent knowledge management infrastructure for modeling and simulation. Velo leverages, integrates, and extends open source collaborative and content management technologies to create a scalable and flexible core platform that can be tailored to specific scientific domains. We describe the architecture of Velo for managing and associating the various types of data that are used and created in modeling and simulation projects, as well as the framework for integrating domain-specific tools. To demonstrate a realization of Velo, we describe the Geologic Sequestration Software Suite (GS3) that has been developed to support geologic sequestration modeling. This provides a concrete example of the inherent extensibility and utility of our approach."

The process contains four steps, reverse engineering, requirements reengineering, redesign and source code refactoring. In the requirements reengineering step, we employ a novel approach to elicit requirements efficiently for such a scientific computing project. \nThrough the reengineering process, the documentation of source code, requirements and the improved design is generated, the system is more modularized and easier to be extended, as well as the source code are more comprehensible.

  "Abstract": "The implications of an aging U.S. population indicate that a large portion of the population will receive limited access to the healthcare they need, unless clinical preventive services are provided. Patient-centered healthcare, in which patients gain more access to and control over their own health, is becoming an important part of clinical preventive services and so is software. Healthcare entails highly complex processes that require substantial communication between different healthcare professionals. A major concern for patient-centered software is that it must adapt to changing needs to support long-term wellbeing, i.e., new knowledge must be considered continuously as part of the software lifecycle. This position paper contends that research efforts should be directed toward software engineering solutions that consider evolution as a part of the software lifecycle and use a variety of feedback channels to direct evolution, and presents a research agenda integrated with an approach that addresses evolving needs through a continuous data-driven requirements engineering (RE) technique."

While incidental reports about failures of PMS have been published, little information is available about their outcome and severity. Such evidence would be useful for focusing research efforts. In this paper, we report on a study that seeks to contribute to building up such evidence. We analyzed FDA records of safety incidents with PMS that were submitted over a period of two years.

The ever growing amount of available data and the constantly increasing specialization in medicine makes it almost impossible for a patient to get personalized medical information even though this is crucial for a self determined decision. We therefore propose a system that combines epidemiological data, personal medical data, personal data and publicly available data to form one central source of information. We argue that, with currently available methods and data, a patient adapted information system is attainable."

To mitigate these costs, increasing numbers of disabled and elderly people (our clientele) will live alone at home. This paper suggests that the safety of such disabled and elderly people might be increased by using precise process definitions of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) as the basis for guiding and monitoring their activities. We propose to model ADLs using Little-JIL, a language that supports ADL definitions that are distinguished from other ADL definitions in the literature by their use of such features as concurrency, exception handling, reaction control, and channel communication, all of which are important for monitoring ADLs at appropriately low levels of detail. \nThis paper uses making tea, making a sandwich and answering a phone, as example ADLs for process definition. It suggests how a client can be monitored in real-time to detect unsafe ADL performance deviations that may lead to hazards. It also suggests how monitoring histories can be used for automated assessments that can provide care providers/specialists with key information about trends."

  "Abstract": "Due to its critical nature with respect to patient safety, privacy and other quality attribute, healthcare software is often subject to third party certification. To take a solitary example, Health Canada deems patient management systems (such as Electronic Medical Records) to be subject to mandatory certification and licensing. One strategy to reduce the cost of certifying large software products is to dislocate the implementation of functions that require certification from those functions that do not require certification. While this strategy has been recommended, no systematic method has been proposed on how to integrate this notion into the overall system design process. This paper addresses this gap. We present a process that takes a requirements specification and pertinent certification criteria as input and produces a set of constraints on potential architecture designs, ensuring that the size of software that must undergo certification is reduced. We demonstrate the approach using a real-world case study involving Electronic Health Record software in the context of the Canadian regulatory framework."

This paper takes a first step towards engineering EHR requirements to support collaborative care delivery by defining a set of collaborative competencies. These competencies emphasize process interoperability through separation of data and processes. The findings from this paper can help inform EHR design to support collaborative care delivery."

Software can also be used to simulate medical processes and protocols to measure cost effectiveness and resource utilization. Whereas much of the software engineering research into simulation software focuses on validation (determining that the simulation accurately models real-world activity), to date there has been little investigation into the testing of simulation software itself, that is, the ability to effectively search for errors in the implementation. This is particularly challenging because often there is no test oracle to indicate whether the results of the simulation are correct. In this paper, we present an approach to systematically testing simulation software in the absence of test oracles, and evaluate the effectiveness of the technique."

An integrated case study of cardiac care processes and performance analytics we have been developing at a community hospital in Ontario is used to illustrate our approach. We analyze how fine-grained metrics can be linked into cardiac care processes to address high level performance objectives, and present a technology assessment to identify how software engineering support for the collection and communication of these fine-grained metrics can be provided."

  "Abstract": "Incentives and penalties for healthcare providers as laid out in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 have caused tremendous growth in the development and installation of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the US. For the benefit of protecting patient privacy, regulations and certification criteria related to EHR systems stipulate the use of access control of protected health information. The goal of this research is to guide development teams, regulators, and certification bodies by assessing the state of the practice in EHR access control. In this paper, we present a compilation of 25 criteria relative to access control in EHR systems found in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulation, meaningful use certification criteria, best practices embodied in the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) role-based access control standard, and other best practices found in the literature. We then examine the state of the practice in access control by evaluating four open source EHR systems using these 25 evaluation criteria. Our research indicates that the NIST Meaningful Use criteria provide HIPAA compliance, but none of the regulatory and certification criteria address the implementation standards, and best practices related to access control. Additionally, our results indicate that open source EHR system designers are not implementing robust access control mechanisms for the adequate protection of patient data."

  "Abstract": "Simulation-based training has been an integral part of health-sciences education for many years, and is becoming increasingly important with the shift towards competency-based education. Virtual worlds have emerged as an effective way to deliver realistic, collaborative training in complex processes, which is consistent with competency-based training and assessment. We have developed MeRiTS, a virtual world-based platform for creating training simulations, to provide students in a wide range of disciplines with this kind of training. Furthermore, through these student training experiences, we will be able to provide a rigorous, comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of conducting scenario-based training in virtual worlds. In this paper, we briefly present the MeRiTS architecture, and the underlying theories, components and models that support the system. We then present a detailed description of our most mature scenario, which trains paramedics in proper rescue and patient handoff procedures. We also provide an in-depth discussion of the development process for this scenario, and conclude with some lessons learned from the experience."

  "Abstract": "Application development on wireless sensor networks is becoming more and more challenging due to increasing complexity of applications and lack of dedicated programming models. Developers should concentrate on the application logic, while network designers should ensure the network and sensor performance. However, in reality, these two roles often overlap because the architectural and programming abstraction between the network and application is missing. Research on middleware and language that bridges these two abstraction levels is still in a preliminary stage. \nThis paper proposes a macro language based on our previous work COPAL (COntext Provisioning for ALl). COPAL is a runtime context provisioning middleware that, via a loosely-coupled and composable architecture, ensures context information from wireless sensor networks and other sources can be processed for the needs of context-aware applications. COPAL-ML is a macro language that extends Java programming language and is tailored for the application development using COPAL. Its main task is to reduce development efforts, hide the inherent complexity of COPAL API, and separate concerns of the context-aware application from underlining wireless sensor network."

  "Abstract": "Protocols for sensor networks are commonly coupled to the specific operating system (OS), for instance TinyOS, involv- ing some drawbacks. First, programmers must learn OS architecture, programming guidelines, sometimes a new pro- gramming language, etc. Second, protocols run on the spe- cific OS only, i.e. on the hardware supported by the OS. Third, only selected network simulators, mostly provided by OS, can execute the OS-coupled code. To tackle the problems with interoperability we examined the idea of cross-platform protocol development for sensor networks, i.e. software running on several OSs, and share our experience in this paper. Our primary cross-platform MAC protocol runs on two OSs and on a hardware platform supporting the C program- ming language. To achieve interoperability we decoupled MAC from OS calls and provided a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) for each OS. We discovered that such an ap- proach does not result in a significant penalty in terms of occupied memory (e.g. smaller by 3 kB than the TinyOS- dedicated version) and consumed energy (additional over- head smaller by three orders of magnitude from total tx energy)."

Up today model-driven engineering techniques have only been limitedly considered in this domain, although they would enable a set of activities aimed at improving the quality of software. In this paper we investigate the possibility to adapt an existing model-based approach that exploits such techniques to combine the modeling and performance analysis of software for WSN. We introduce a UML-based framework where a system model (i) is extended with a new profile for representing NesC application along with the supporting hardware platform, and (ii) is annotated with performance parameters defined in the standard UML MARTE profile. Thereafter we apply a set of transformations to this enhanced UML model that targets a Queueing Network performance model. Finally we illustrate our approach at work on a case study in the agricultural domain."

Both of these operating systems are open-source projects and basically frameworks for WSN developers. In this paper, we study the software repositories of these two projects. Software repositories provide a wealth of information on software projects and their development. Based on the mined information, we explore the TinyOS and Contiki commit history and compare them to an open-source embedded operating system, Ethernut. As a second step, we explore WSN-specific artifacts and mine TinyOS software for cross-cutting concerns. Most of the relations we find are not cross-cutting. Nevertheless, we do find cross-cutting concerns that are resource-related."

  "Abstract": "In order to develop Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications, it is necessary to develop prototypes in a low-cost way and to optimize application performance. Existing development approaches enable to develop a low-cost prototype by concealing the detail of WSN from the developers. However, there is a trade-off between the development cost of prototype and the description capability needed to optimize the application performance. We propose a Model-Driven Development (MDD) process to enable a low-cost prototyping and detailed optimization. To enable such a development process, we define modeling languages, which describe an application at three abstraction levels, and transformation rules, which transform models described by our modeling language to concrete one. Using our process, in prototyping, the developer describes a model by using the modeling language at the highest abstraction level and automatically obtains an executable model by using transformation rules. In addition, in optimizing, the developer can automatically obtain the models at more concrete abstraction level than the prototype by using transformation rules and modifies them in greater detail by using each modeling language."

  "Abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are increasingly used in various application domains like home-automation, agriculture, industries and infrastructure monitoring. As applications tend to leverage larger geographical deployments of sensor networks, the availability of an intuitive and user- friendly programming abstraction becomes a crucial factor in enabling faster and more efficient development, and re- programming of applications. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a programming pattern named sMapReduce, inspired by the Google MapReduce framework, for mapping application behaviors on to a sensor network and enabling complex data aggregation. The proposed pattern requires a user to create a network-level application in two functions: sMap and Reduce, in order to abstract away from the low- level details without sacrificing the freedom to develop complex logic. Such a two-fold division of programming logic is a natural-fit to typical sensor networking operation which makes sensing and topological modalities accessible to the user."

  "Abstract": "One of the important factors in ensuring the correct functionality of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is the reliability of the software running on individual sensor nodes. Research has shown that path-sensitive static analysis is effective for bug detection and fault diagnosis; however, path-sensitive analysis is prohibitively expensive when applied to a WSN application due to the large state space caused by arbitrary interrupt preemptions. In this paper, we propose a new execution model called lazy preemption that reduces this state space by restricting interrupt handlers to a set of pre-determined preemption points, if possible. This execution model allows us to represent the program with an inter-interrupt control flow graph (IICFG), which is easier to analyze than the original CFGs with arbitrary interrupt preemptions."

The IOT is a massive cyber-physical system that presents many software engineering challenges. One fundamental challenge is the need for multi-dimensional QoS that can satisfy the individual constraints of the many participants in the system. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of providing such a mechanism via a simple abstraction consisting of a general QoS function provided by each application. This function distills the multi-dimensional QoS specifications from each stakeholder into a single value that is used to determine the best configuration of interactions. We prototype our approach in a real wireless sensor network using a pervasive healthcare fall-detection application and highlight the many challenges it unveils."

  "Abstract": "Allocating code inspection and testing resources to the most problematic code areas is important to reduce development time and cost. While complexity metrics collected statically from software artifacts are known to be helpful in finding vulnerable code locations, some complex code is rarely executed in practice and has less chance of its vulnerabilities being detected. To augment the use of static complexity metrics, this study examines execution complexity metrics that are collected during code execution as indicators of vulnerable code locations. We conducted case studies on two large size, widely-used open source projects, the Mozilla Firefox web browser and the Wireshark network protocol analyzer. Our results indicate that execution complexity metrics are better indicators of vulnerable code locations than the most commonly-used static complexity metric, lines of source code. The ability of execution complexity metrics to discriminate vulnerable code locations from neutral code locations and to predict vulnerable code locations vary depending on projects. However, the vulnerability prediction models using execution complexity metrics are superior to the models using static complexity metrics in reducing inspection effort."

The goal of certification is to identify where controls are implemented correctly and where they are violated, creating potential vulnerability risks. Certification complexity is magnified in software composed of systems of systems where there are limited formal methodologies to express management policies, given a set of security control properties, and verify them against the interaction of the participating components and their individual security policy implementations. In this paper, we extend Context UNITY, a formal, distributed, and context aware coordination language to support policy controls. The new language features enforce security controls and provide a means to declare policy specifics in a manner similar to declaring variable types. We use these features in a specification to show how verifying system compliance with selected security controls, such as those found in the NIST SP800-53 document, can be accomplished."

Indeed, we investigate on the set of requirements a refinement function has to satisfy for preserving a class of properties that can be formalized as specific instances of a general scheme, called Generalized Non Deducibility on Composition (GNDC). Hence, we show that it is possible to guarantee that the refinement of a considered system that is verified to be GNDC at a high level of abstraction, is GNDC also at a lower one without checking it again."

Some contributions have focused on integrating security aspects, mainly access control mechanisms, at the implementation phase. Others pay a particular attention to the capture and analysis of security requirements. However, to our knowledge, no method addresses the whole problem of the specification of security requirements and their transformation through all the phases of the IS development life cycle. We argue that better Secured IS can be obtained if security issues are taken into account at an earlier phase of the system life cycle and integrated with functional aspects along the whole life cycle. This paper is a step forward to a comprehensive security conceptual meta-model encompassing the main security properties such as availability, integrity, confidentiality, and accountability. It integrates functional and non-functional requirements. It includes social, organizational as well as informational aspects. This meta-model is the backbone of our approach."

This work shows that this technique can scale by composing the results obtained from the analysis of the sub-parts of a larger system. The technique decomposes the system into independently described subsystems and a description listing the interactions between these subsystems. These descriptions are thence analyzed to obtain LP violations and subsequently composed to obtain the violations of the overall system."

  "Abstract": "Because software provides much of the critical services for modern society, it is vitally important to provide methodologies and tools for building and deploying reliable software. While there have been many advances towards this goal, much research remains to be done. For example, a recent evaluation of five state-of-the-art C/C++ static analysis tools applied to a corpus of code containing common weaknesses revealed that 41% of the potential vulnerabilities were detected by no tool. The problem of deploying resilient software is further complicated because modern software is often assembled from components from many sources. Consequently, it is difficult to know who built a particular component and what processes were used in its construction. Our research goal is to develop and demonstrate technology that provides comprehensive, automated techniques that allow end users to safely execute new software of uncertain provenance. This paper presents an overview of our vision for realizing these goals and outlines some of the challenging research problems that must be addressed to realize our vision. We call our vision PEASOUP and have begun implementing and evaluating these ideas."

  "Abstract": "The process of designing and building a software system requires making many decisions. These decisions, the al- ternatives considered, and the reasons behind the choices comprise the rationale for the completed system. The driv- ing force behind many, if not most, of these decisions is the need to meet the stakeholder requirements for the system being developed. Software product line approaches allow developers to design and develop families of products that share a common platform of behaviors and infrastructure. These approaches are based on assembling a con guration of a set of common features (commonalities) along with a set of product specifi c features (variabilities) to form a new product with a low amount of e ort. In this context, these variabilities represent a wide variety of potential design al- ternatives. The goal of our research is to bring the end-user into the process of con guring a software product through the use of system level rationale that maps product line features to system requirements. Speci cally, in our approach we specify rationale at the level of a feature diagram. Accordingly, we are taking advantage of the natural correlation between alternative features in a feature diagram and the alternative structure used in design rationale. This allows the end-user to indicate which requirements apply to their product and to have that selection generate a set of product features that satisfy those requirements."

  "Abstract": "A company's architecture knowledge is often personalized across specific people that share experience and knowledge in the field. However, this knowledge may be important for other stakeholders. Omitting the codification of the architecture knowledge may result in ad-hoc practices, which is particularly relevant for software evolution. In a collaboration with Egemin, an industrial manufacturer of logistic systems, we faced the problem with a lack of codified architecture knowledge in the context of the evolution of a software product line (SPL). In particular, maintainers lack the architecture knowledge that is needed to perform the evolution tasks of deployed products correctly and efficiently. Ad-hoc updates increase costs and harm the company's reputation. \nTo address this problem, we developed an automated approach for evolving deployed systems of a SPL. Central in this approach are (1) a meta-model that codifies the architecture knowledge required to support evolution of a SPL, and (2) and algorithm that uses the architecture knowledge harvested from a deployed system based on the meta-model to generate the list of tasks maintainers have to perform to evolve the system. Evaluation of the approach demonstrates a significant improvement of the quality of system updates with respect to the correct execution of updates and the availability of services during the updates."

  "Abstract": "Architectural analysis processes, such as the Architecture Trade-o and Analysis Method (ATAM), utilize a scenario based approach to evaluate the extent to which an architectural solution meets a potentially competing set of quality goals. The resulting architectural documents contain a rich set of trace relationships between quality goals, decisions, and architectural elements. Unfortunately this information is not readily accessible for supporting tasks other than initial architectural assessments. In this paper we describe a technique and supporting tools for extracting and generating traceability links from the architectural documents. A specialized Traceability Information Model is used to guide the user through the task of establishing traceability links from design decisions to the architectural elements in which the decision is realized. The retrieved and generated traceability links can then be used to support a far broader set of activities including visualization of design rationale and architectural preservation. We evaluate our approach using a case study of the NASA Crew Exploration Vehicle."

  "Abstract": "Methods of representing and capturing design rationale have been studied in past years. Many meta-models, methods and techniques have been proposed. Are these software engineering methods sufficient to help designers make logical and appropriate design decisions? Studies have shown that people make biased decisions, software designers may also be subjected to such cognitive biases. In this paper, I give an overview of how cognitive biases and reasoning failures may lead to unsound design decisions. I conjecture that in order to improve the overall quality of software design, we as a community need to improve our understanding and teaching of software design reasoning."

These systems utilize different aspects from the context of the cursor position within the source file being edited for inferring which functionality is needed next. Current approaches are based on structural information like inheritance relations or type/method usages. We propose a novel method that utilizes the knowledge embodied in the identifiers as a basis for the recommendation of API methods. This approach has the advantage that relevant recommendations can also be made in cases where no methods are called in the context or if contexts use distinct but semantically similar types or methods. First experiments show, that the correct method is recommended in about one quarter to one third of the cases."

We propose a graph matching-based technique between software models to address content-based query (a.k.a., query by example) on project repositories so as to retrieve significant model fragments for reuse. This can be extremely valuable in a scenario where the designer has a rough idea of the model or pattern he needs, he quickly sketches a coarse schema, and wants to retrieve projects that contain matching patterns (with all the details in place). Our approach encompasses the transformation of models into suitable graphs, the definition of a similarity function and an implementation within a search engine platform. In this paper we present the graph matching approach of the query model against the model repository and we evaluate different configurations of the similarity function."

This paper takes an approach of finding services by first finding process fragments. We take BPEL as an example of a behavioral process model that describes an SOS.

  "Abstract": "Automating software testing can significantly reduce the time and effort required to assure the quality of software systems, and over recent years significant strides have been made in test automation techniques. However, one aspect of software testing that has always resisted full automation is the determination of the expected results for given system states and input values -- the so called ``oracle problem''. Fortunately, the recent advent of a new generation of software search engines containing millions of reusable software artifacts offers an elegant solution to this dilemma. Once a search engine is able to deliver multiple results that conform to a given specification (by searching for and adapting preexisting components), multi-version testing of software with ``harvested'' oracles becomes a feasible alternative to manual oracle definition. In this paper we present an approach to Search-Enhanced Testing with a focus on the discovery of discrepancies between the results returned by harvested test oracles and a Component Under Test for randomly generated test invocations. Our current research focuses on validating the hypothesis that human test engineers will find more defects when analyzing such automatically discovered discrepancies than when developing test cases using traditional coverage criteria."

As a result, we created the Source code ECOsystem Linked Data (SECOLD) framework that adheres to the Linked Data publication standard. The framework provides not only source code and facts that are usable by both humans and machines for browsing or querying, but it will also assist the research community at large in sharing and utilizing a standardized source code representation. The dataset has been submitted and registered to ckan.net, under the SECOLD project name, as the first source code Linked Data repository.

  "Abstract": "Software projects use different repositories for storing project and evolution information such as source code, bugs and patches. An integrated system that combines these multiple repositories and can answer a broad range of queries regarding the project&#8217;s evolution history would be beneficial to both software developers and researchers. For example, the list of source code changes or the list of developers associated with a bug fix are frequent queries for both developers and researchers. Integrating and gathering this information is a tedious, cumbersome, error-prone process when done manually, especially for large projects. Previous approaches to this problem use frameworks that limit the user to a set of pre-defined query templates, or use query languages with limited power. In this paper, we argue the need for a framework built with recursively enumerable languages, that can answer temporal queries, and sup- ports negation and recursion. As a first step toward such a frame- work, we present a Prolog-based system that we built, along with an evaluation of real-world integrated data from the Firefox project. Our system allows for elegant and concise, yet powerful queries, and can be used by developers and researchers for frequent development and empirical analysis tasks."

This paper addresses this knowledge gap. We present the results of a log file analysis of a source code search engine. The data from the log file was analyzed together with the change history of four development and maintenance systems. The results show that most of the search targets were not changed after being downloaded, thus we concluded that the developers conducted searches to find reusable components, to obtain coding examples or to perform impact analysis. In contrast, maintainers often change the code they have downloaded. Moreover, we automatically categorized the search queries. The most popular categories were: method name, structural pattern, and keyword. The major search target was a statement. Although the selected data set was small, the deviations between the systems were negligible, therefore we conclude that our results are valid."

One, developers want to find procedural information, such as quick references about how to solve some programming problems. Two, developers use the Web as a memory aid to remember details about how to solve a problem they solved before. Three, developers want to solve a knowledge problem, for example, learning some new concepts. Four, developers want to find information to understand and solve errors.

Source code demands special attention in the indexing process. In this paper, we investigate source code indexing for supporting automatic traceability. We introduce a feature diagram that captures the key components and their relationships in the domain of source code indexing. We then present an experiment to examine the features of the diagram and their dependencies. Results show that utilizing comments has a significant effect on traceability link generation, and stemming is required when comments are considered."

By determining the impact of changing a given set of features, IS development organizations can build a clear understanding of the effort that these changes will require. In this paper, we propose a technique which uses traceability to build a bridge between function points and source code.

Existing approaches to recover links between a bug and the methods changed to fix the bug rely on the presence of the bug's identifier in a CVS log message. In this paper we present an approach that relies instead on the presence of a patch in the issue report for the bug. That is, rather than analyzing deltas retrieved from CVS to recover links, our approach analyzes patches retrieved from Bugzilla. We use BugTrace, the tool implementing our approach, to conduct a case study in which we compare the links recovered by our approach to links recovered by manual inspection. The results of the case study support the efficacy of our approach. After describing the limitations of our case study, we conclude by reviewing closely related work and suggesting possible future work."

An ability to trace backwards to an identified environmental assumption, and to trace forwards to find the areas of a DAS's specification that are affected by a change in environmental understanding aids in supporting this necessarily iterative RE process. This paper demonstrates how claims, a record in an i* SR model of an assumption made, can be used as markers for areas of uncertainty in a DAS specification. The paper demonstrates backward tracing using claims to identify faulty environmental understanding, and forward tracing to allow generation of new behaviour in the form of policy adaptations and models for transitioning the running system."

  "Abstract": "Most log files are of one format - a flat file with the events of execution recorded one after the other. Each line in the file contains at least a timestamp, a combination of one or more event identifiers, and the actual log message with information of which event was executed and what the values for the dynamic parameters of that event are. Since log files have this trace information, we can use it for many purposes, such as operational profiling and anomalous execution path detection. However the current flat file format of a log file is very unintuitive to detect the existence of a repeating pattern. In this paper we propose a transformation of the current serial order format of a log file to a directed cyclic graph (such as a non-finite state machine) format and how the operational profile of a system can be built from this representation of the log file. We built a tool (in C++), that transforms a log file with a set of log events in a serial order to an adjacency matrix for the resulting graphical representation. We can then easily apply existing graph theory based algorithms on the adjacency matrix to analyze the log file of the system. The directed cyclic graph and the analysis of it can be visualized by rendering the adjacency matrix with graph visualization tools, like Graphviz."

This paper introduces a theoretical model of analyst effort as well as a simplified model. A number of simulations were undertaken in order to build effort curves to assist in evaluating numerous tracing scenarios, such as determining at what point in time an analyst should switch from vetting candidate links to manually searching for links not in the candidate list."

From early published traceability metamodels to current requirements traceability literature, the client organization and the stakeholders are first-class citizens, but the software engineers and the interactions between these groups are not. In this paper we present a partially formalized RichPicture traceability model to fill this gap. ITrace is a flexible model to weave together the social network graph, the information sources graph, the social interactions graph, and the Requirements Engineering artifacts evolution graph.

Our integrated courseware, SEREBRO, provides a framework of tools that capture conversation and artifact creation and modification throughout the software development lifecycle by student team members developing non-trivial software products in a Software Engineering course. Using a data driven approach, we investigate the use of lightweight tagging mechanisms applied by student software project teams and present some preliminary results of this investigation."

  "Abstract": "Numerous trace retrieval algorithms incorporate the standard tf-idf (term frequency, inverse document frequency) technique to weight various terms. In this TEFSE challenge report we address Grand Challenge C-GC1 by comparing the effectiveness of computing idf based only on the local terms in the query, versus computing it based on general term usage as documented in the American National Corpus. We also address Grand Challenges L-GC1 and L-GC2 by setting ourselves the additional task of designing and conducting the experiments using the alpha-release of TraceLab. TraceLab is an experimental workbench which allows researchers to graphically model and execute a traceability experiment as a workflow of components. Results of the experiment show that the local idf approach exceeds or matches the global approach in all of the cases studied."

  "Abstract": "The majority of IDEs implement a concept of plug-in that nicely supports the integration of tools within the IDEs. Plug-ins dramatically simplify the structural integration of multiple tools, but provide little support to the design of the dynamic of the integration, which must be entirely coded by programmers from plug-ins' API. Manually integrating plug-ins is costly, complex and requires a deep understanding of the underlying environment. The implementation of tools as plug-ins and the integration of the results produced by di erent plug-ins are still difficult, expensive and error-prone activities. This paper presents the concepts of Task Based Plug-in (TB-plug-in) and workflow of TB-plug-ins. In our vision, IDE users must be able to execute plug-ins and integrate their results by designing workflows that can be persisted, executed and re-used in other workflows. We validated our idea by refactoring a set of Eclipse plug-ins for log- file analysis into TB-plug-ins, and designing several workflows that integrate plug-in tasks. We compared the e ffort necessary to implement these analyses from plug-ins with the eff ort necessary to design the workflows from TB-plug-ins. We discovered that workflows can be easily designed with little knowledge about the IDE and the plug-ins' API, save signi cant eff ort otherwise devoted to the implementation of additional plug-ins and glue-code, and produce analyses that can be quickly modified and reused."

  "Abstract": "Automated software verification is an active field of research which has made enormous progress both in theoretical and practical aspects. In recent years, an important effort has been put into applying these techniques on top of mainstream programming languages. These languages typically provide powerful features such as reflection, aliasing and polymorphism which are handy for practitioners but, in contrast, make verification a real challenge. The Pest programming language, on the other and, was conceived with verifiability as one of its main design drivers. Although its main purpose is to serve as a test bed for new language features, its bare-bones syntax and strong support for annotations suggested early on in its development that it could also serve as a teaching tool for first-year undergraduate students. Developing an Eclipse plug-in for Pest proved to be both cost-effective and a key part to its adoption in the classroom. In this paper, we report on this experience."

This paper discusses the two-way solution Ginga proposes for its plug-ins. Ginga defines an API that allows third party tools as NCL (the declarative language of Ginga) player&#8217;s plug-ins for specific media-object type exhibition that composes a DTV application presentation in its whole. As NCL allows nested NCL applications, an NCL application itself acts as a plug-in of another parent NCL application, therefore obeying the same plug-in API previously mentioned. In general, the same NCL plug-in API can be used to allow applications specified in other languages to be embedded in NCL applications, as well as to allow NCL applications to be embedded in other presentation environments, in particular the Ginga-NCL environment. This two-way bridge is exemplified in this paper between NCL and HTML applications."

For example, deciding between a web-based application or a plug-in-based application has a significant impact on the architecture, therefore in order to make the right choice all possible tradeoffs between them must be considered. Decisions need to be made in all architectural views, from the logical view in which architectural styles are chosen, to the development view in which types of modules are decided, to the deployment view where physical allocation is determined. In this paper we analyze the interactions between a 3-layer architecture at the logical view, and a plug-in-based development view implemented in Eclipse, focusing on the difficulties we overcome in a research project in order to make it work."

As part of our AODVis (Aspect-Oriented Development Visualization) framework, we are developing Eclipse plugins to reverse-engineer and visualize AspectJ projects as 3D UML-based detailed design, architecture, and analysis level models. \nThe AODVis plugins leverage several existing Eclipse plugins to extract program facts, create and manipulate UML, transform program facts into models, and generate visualizations of the models. Although integration can be challenging, the broad range of plugins are invaluable in providing solutions for extending and integrating existing tools such as compilers and IDEs. The plugins and the Eclipse plugin architecture also allowed us to concentrate on our specific research problem instead of developing our own tool support from scratch."

  "Abstract": "RDB2RDF is the process by which a relational database schema (RDB) is transformed into a set of RDF triples. A major step in this process is deciding how to represent database schema concepts in terms of RDF classes and properties. This correlation is described in the RDB2RDF mapping file, which is used as the base for the generation of RDF triples. Most RDB2RDF engines today provide support to the mechanical process of transforming RDB to RDF, each with its own mapping language. Due to this fact, the W3C RDB2RDF Working Group has been working to standardize a language to map relational data to RDF called R2RML. Part of their efforts is directed to fostering the development of methods, tools and techniques to support standard RDB2RDF mapping strategies. In this paper, we introduce an Eclipse plug-in that supports the standard RDB to RDF Mapping Language (R2RML) to produce Direct Mappings in RDF."

This paper presents an architecture and the corresponding infrastructure that allow administrators to define what they want to monitor and manage and automate the discovery and deployment of corresponding probes and related management console graphical plug-ins.

  "Abstract": "Strategic release planning (SRP) is a critical step in iterative software development. SRP involves the assignment of features or requirements to releases while considering hard and soft constraints, such as time, effort, quality or resources. ReleasePlanner&#8482; is a web-based decision support tool that is based on a sound and rigorous formal strategic release planning model. In this paper we describe the integration of ReleasePlanner&#8482; with Visual Studio in the form of a Visual Studio plug-in called SRP-Plugin. The SRP-Plugin is used to demonstrate our hypothesis that tools implemented as plug-ins for widely used development platform (such as Visual Studio) help to increase efficiency of the development process. The plug-in augments the rich Visual Studio environment with advanced release planning capabilities which result in better release planning quality, increased productivity and enhanced communication among project stakeholders. The added value of providing systematic release planning as part of a development is not limited to release planning alone. We have outlined the future work to extend SRP-Plugin to include proactive decision making features such as utilization of sensitivity analysis and machine learning techniques to provide recommendations for the project manager during the challenging task of deciding which sets of features should be offered to whom, when, and why."

  "Abstract": "Dynamic languages are becoming increasingly popular for different software development scenarios such as rapid prototyping because of the flexibility and agile interactive development they offer. The benefits of dynamic languages are, however, counteracted by many limitations produced by the lack of static typing. In order to obtain the benefits of both approaches, some programming languages offer a hybrid dynamic and static type system. The existing IDEs for these hybrid typing languages do not provide any type-based feature when dynamic typing is used, lacking important IDE facilities offered for statically typed code. We have implemented a constraint-based type inference system that gathers type information of dynamic references at compile time. Using this type information, we have extended a professional IDE to offer those type-based features missed for dynamically typed code. Following the Separation of Concerns principle, the IDE has also been customized to facilitate the conversion of dy-namically typed code into statically typed one, and vice versa."

Contractor.NET uses and extends Code Contracts to provide stronger contract specifications. It features a two step process. First, a class source code is analyzed to extract a finite state behavior model (in the form of a typestate) that is amenable to human-in-the-loop validation and refinement. The second step is to augment the original contract specification for the input class with the inferred typestate information, therefore enabling the verification of client code. The inferred typestates are enabledness preserving: a level of abstraction that has been successfully used to validate software artifacts, assisting in the detection of a number of concerns in various case studies including specifications of Microsoft Server protocols."

These benefits must be weighed against the effort to integrate the tool into the IDE, effort which may need to be repeated for each IDE targeted. In this paper, we introduce Fishtail, a prototype plugin for the Eclipse IDE, which assists programmers in discovering code examples and documentation on the web relevant to their current task. Fishtail uses a detailed history of programmer interactions with the source code to automatically determine relevant web resources. We describe the key factors that make it attractive to implement Fishtail as a plugin, and the requirements Fishtail imposes on the plugin/IDE interface. To reach a broader user base and understand how well our tool supports different programming styles and IDE architectures, we have recently begun investigating how to make a version of Fishtail available in the Visual Studio IDE. We outline some of the challenges we face in trying to reuse code from the original Eclipse plugin."

The Container Database (CDB) abstraction provides a cloud-based solution for scenarios where device local storage is not sufficient for manipulating data. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach we present an implementation of the CDB abstraction as an API designed to work with a Visual Studio 2010 plug-in, using Windows Azure Cloud services."

In this experience report we describe the Turbine Design Tool (TDT), our approach in developing a plug-in based design tool that encapsulates and integrates the legacy tools into a single, component-based, extendable environment that offers the advantages of an integrated solution while minimising the cost and disruption to the business and that allows for the gradual replacement of the tools."

The goal of the OthelloPlay tool is to support formalization of textual requirements and to simplify the use of formal techniques for requirements validation. The tool combines a formal verification engine and the Microsoft Word(R) editor in a single and consistent environment. A fundamental key in our design approach is a plug-in-based architecture, which uses the Python language in conjunction with a Microsoft Word(R) Add-In. The user can jump between textual requirements in the Microsoft Word(R) editor and the corresponding formal requirements model."

  "Abstract": "Many programs are being created by end-users without formal training in programming. Spreadsheets are the most popular environment for this, but mashups which combine public services into new, albeit small applications are also becoming more and more popular. Research shows that end-user programmers make potentially costly mistakes. Yet initiatives that aim at bringing software engineering principles to end-users are still rudimentary. In particular, we see much unused potential in approaches that foster and support the cooperation among end-user programmers. Whereas the application of mechanisms from social software to software engineering problems is gaining traction, this has not yet been investigated sufficiently for end-user software engineering. This paper discusses how insights from Communities of Practice research may be implemented using mechanisms from recent developments in social software. From the implementation of the presented social mechanisms, we expect an improvement in cooperation and mutual help in communities of end-user programmers. We plan to combine this approach with lightweight variations of software engineering methods targeted at end-user programmers. This should lead to higher quality in the programs developed by these end-users, as good practices are more likely to spread."

To understand whether documentation via social media can replace or augment more traditional forms of documentation, we study the extent to which the methods of one particular API -- jQuery -- are documented on the Web. We analyze 1,730 search results and show that software development blogs in particular cover 87.9% of the API methods, mainly featuring tutorials and personal experiences about using the methods. Further, this effort is shared by a large group of developers contributing just a few blog posts. Our findings indicate that social media is more than a niche in software documentation, that it can provide high levels of coverage and that it gives readers a chance to engage with authors."

  "Abstract": "In this keynote I explore what exactly do we mean by data quality, techniques to assess data quality and the very significant challenges that poor data quality can pose. I believe we neglect data quality at our peril since &#8212; whether we like it or not &#8212; our research results are founded upon data and our assumptions that data quality issues do not confound our results. A systematic review of the literature suggests that it is a minority practice to even explicitly discuss data quality. I therefore suggest that this topic should become a higher priority amongst empirical software engineering researchers."

  "Abstract": "To assess the quality of software, two ingredients are available today: (1) quality models defining abstract quality characteristics and (2) code analysis tools providing a large variety of metrics. However, there exists a gap between these two worlds. The quality attributes defined in quality models are too abstract to be operationalized. On the other side, the aggregation of the results of static code analysis tools remains a challenge. We address these problems by defining a quality model based on an explicit meta-model. It allows to operationalize quality models by defining how metrics calculated by tools are aggregated. Furthermore, we propose a new approach for normalizing the results of rule-based code analysis tools, which uses the information on the structure of the source code in the quality model. We evaluate the quality model by providing tool support for both developing quality models and conducting automatic quality assessments. Our results indicate that large quality models can be built based on our meta-model. The automatic assessment shows a high correlation between the automatic assessment and an expert-based ranking."

  "Abstract": "The Truck Factor is a simple way, proposed by the agile community, to measure the system&#8217;s knowledge distribution in a team of developers. It can be used to highlight potential project problems due to the inadequate distribution of the system knowledge. Notwithstanding its relevance, only few studies investigated the Truck Factor and proposed ways to efficiently measure, evaluate and use it. In particular, the effective use of the Truck Factor is limited by the lack of reliable thresholds. In this preliminary paper, we present a theoretical model concerning the Truck Factor and, in particular, we investigate its use to define the maximum achievable Truck Factor value in a project. The relevance of such a value concerns the definition of a reliable threshold for the Truck Factor. Furthermore in the paper, we document an experiment in which we apply the proposed model to real software projects with the aim of comparing the maximum achievable value of the Truck Factor with the unique threshold proposed in literature. The preliminary outcome we achieved shows that the existing threshold has some limitations and problems."

In this work we evaluate to what extent experienced developers change their activities during mentoring activities in Pair Programming (PP) and, in this case, how long this effect can be observed. We compare how the experienced developers use the tools when working with other experts and when with new developers. The results indicate that there is a notable difference in the way the tools are used between the experts working together and the experts mentoring the new developers that have just joined the team. Moreover, over time the difference between pairs of experts and mixed pairs (experts and novices) working together becomes almost unnoticeable."

  "Abstract": "Fault prediction models usually employ software metrics which were previously shown to be a strong predictor for defects, e.g., SLOC. However, metrics are usually defined on a micro-level (method, class, package), and should therefore be aggregated in order to provide insights in the evolution at the macro-level (system). In addition to traditional aggregation techniques such as the mean, median, or sum, recently econometric aggregation techniques, such as the Gini, Theil, and Hoover indices have been proposed. \nIn this paper we wish to understand whether the aggregation technique influences the presence and strength of the relation between SLOC and defects. Our results indicate that correlation is not strong, and is influenced by the aggregation technique."

Often testing teams lack in-process visibility into the effectiveness of ongoing component testing. Using project data such as code coverage and schedule and effort estimates, we generate temporal and rate-based insights into component testing effectiveness. A simple composite metric is used for measuring and forecasting the health of the component testing process. The early warning signals, based on the forecast and associated insights, lead teams to take proactive actions for improving component testing. In our ongoing experimental studies, we have observed that use of these insights cause a substantial reduction in defect slippage."

This prioritisation could be based on predicted change-proneness of code modules, if a sufficiently accurate prediction can be achieved. Several previous studies have examined links between software change-proneness and software metrics such as size and complexity. However, conclusions differ as to the strength of the relationships. We present here a new case study project, extracting a range of complexity values from the code modules and testing for the existence of a significant link between change-proneness and complexity. We find only limited evidence of a linear relationship, but analysis using other statistical techniques does reveal some other significant links."

However, all metric sets may not be informative for all defect categories such that only one metric type may represent majority of a defect category. Our previous study showed that defect category sensitive prediction models are more successful than general models, since each category has different characteristics in terms of metrics. We extend our previous work, and propose specialized prediction models using churn, code, and network metrics with respect to three defect categories. Results show that churn metrics are the best for predicting all defects. The strength of correlation for code and network metrics varies with defect category: Network metrics have higher correlations than code metrics for defects reported during functional testing and in the field, and vice versa for defects reported during system testing."

  "Abstract": "Structure-based cohesion metrics, such as the well-known Chidamber and Kemerer&#8217;s Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM), fail to capture the semantic notion of a software component&#8217;s cohesion. Some researchers claim that it is one of the reasons they are not good indicators of change proneness. The Lack of Concern-based Cohesion metric (LCC) is an alternative cohesion metric which is centered on counting the number of concerns a component implements. A concern is any important concept, feature, property or area of interest of a system that we want to treat in a modular way. In this way, LCC focus on what really matters for assessing a component&#8217;s cohesion - the amount of responsibilities placed on them. Our aim in this paper is to present an initial investigation about the applicability of this concern-based cohesion metric as a change proneness indicator. We also checked if this metric has a correlation with efferent coupling. An initial empirical assessment work was done with two small to medium-sized systems. Our results indicated a moderate to storng correlation between LCC and change proneness, and also a strong correlation between LCC and efferent coupling."

  "Abstract": "Software metrics, such as code complexity metrics and code churn metrics, are used to predict failures. In this paper we study a specific set of metrics called code construct metrics and relate them to post release failures. We use the values of the code construct metrics for each file to characterize that file. We analyze the code construct metrics along with the post release failure data on the files (that splits the files into two classes: files with post release failures and files without post release failures). In our analysis we compare a file with post release failure to a set of files without post release failures, that have similar characteristics. In our comparison we identify which code construct metric, more often than the others, differs the most between these two classes of files. The goal of our research is to find out which code construct metrics can perhaps be used as symptoms of post release failures. In this paper we analyzed the code construct metrics of Eclipse 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0. Our results indicate that MethodInvocation, QualifiedName, and SimpleName, are the code constructs that differentiates the two classes of files the most and hence are the key symptoms/indicators of a file with post release failures in these versions of Eclipse."

  "Abstract": "We present a study were software systems are considered as complex networks which have a self-similar structure under a length-scale transformation. On such complex software networks we computed a self-similar coefficient, also known as fractal dimension, using &#8220;the box counting method &#8221;. \nWe analyzed various releases of the publically available Eclipse software systems, calculating the fractal dimension for twenty sub-projects, randomly chosen, for every release, as well as for each release as a whole. Our results display an over- all consistency among the sub-projects and among all the analyzed releases. We found a very good correlation between the fractal di- mension and the number of bugs for Eclipse and for twenty sub-projects. Since the fractal dimension is just a scalar number that characterizes a whole system, while complex- ity and quality metrics are in general computed on every system module, this result suggests that the fractal dimen- sion could be considered as a global quality metric for large software systems. Our results need however to be confirmed for other large software systems."

There are few replicated studies using metrics reported in software engineering. Aim: To contribute more data to the body of evidence on the use of novel program slicing-based cohesion metrics. Method: We replicate a very well regarded study by Meyers and Binkley [15, 16] which analyses the cohesion of open source projects using program slicing-based metrics. Results: Our results are very different from Meyers and Binkley&#8217;s original results. This suggests that there are a variety of opportunities for inconsistently to creep into the collection and analysis of metrics data during replicated studies. Conclusion: We conclude that researchers using metrics data must present their work with sufficient detail for replication to be possible. Without this detail it is difficult for subsequent researchers to accurately replicate a study such that consistent and reliable data can be added to a body of evidence."

Results: We find the human aspect is largely ignored, despite the availability of many important results from cognitive psychology.

A specific example in the security domain involves database query execution, in which some of the parameters come from untrusted sources. In Java, the Statement API provides opportunities for SQL injection attacks. The recommended remedy is to replace it with the secure PreparedStatement API; however, that sometimes requires changing the order in which the query is built. We present an algorithm that performs this migration, moving code as necessary to preserve functionality while changing the structure of the original code as little as possible."

Previous research efforts showed that the Extract Method refactoring is often performed prior to other refactorings, so that it is important to support Extract Method refactoring. Previous studies have proposed methods that suggest Extract Method candidates based on linage or complexity. However it is originally desirable to divide methods based on their functionalities. This paper uses the strength of data connection between sentences in the source code. We deem that strongly-connected data expresses a single function.

  "Abstract": "With the increasing popularity of agile software development and Test-Driven-Development, also maintenance of acceptance test has become an important issue. In this paper, we describe a concept and a tool for automated acceptance test maintenance using a refactoring approach. Acceptance tests are user tests which are used to determine if a system satisfies acceptance criteria and to enable a customer to determine whether or not to accept the system. In agile development acceptance test are also used as a mean for specification, i.e. acceptance tests are written in advance to the production code (called Behavior-Driven-Development &#8211; BDD). In an agile project this poses three major challenges with respect to maintenance of acceptance tests: new requirements may cause changes in the acceptance criteria, which require the system under test to be adapted; when the system under test undergoes a major restructuring, even the acceptance test might have to be adapted; with the increasing acceptance test suite in an agile project the tests themselves may undergo a major reorganization. Having a large acceptance test base, doing these refactorings manually is error prone and causes a lot of effort. In this paper we present a concept and tool for executing automated refactoring for Fit acceptance tests, which significantly reduces the effort for test maintenance and makes them much less error prone"

  "Abstract": "Refactoring is a useful practice in developing and maintaining software since it improves the design of existing code without changing its external behavior. Therefore, contemporary integrated development environments tend to include refactoring tools that support automatic transformations of source code. Unfortunately, some of the popular refactoring transformations make existing code vulnerable although they improve its maintainability. The existence of vulnerable code is still a serious issue for many software systems. This paper describes a tool with support for a new class of refactoring concerning software security, which is built as an Eclipse plug-in. It helps programmers to easily know the adverse impact of code changes on security vulnerabilities in the application of refactoring, and provides them with a chance to determine if they could accept or should cancel the applied refactoring. Consequently, they feel safe to improve the maintainability of existing code without missing security vulnerabilities newly inserted into the code. To evaluate the capability of this tool, we made an experiment with it. The experimental results show the usefulness of the tool and also reveal several remaining issues to be tackled."

This paper presents the preliminary results of an explanatory survey aimed at understanding better the longevity of code smells in software projects.

Our initial observations reveal, for instance, that smell removal with refactoring tools is often avoided when maintaining frameworks or product lines."

Code-Imp (Combinatorial Optimisation for Design Improvement) is such an automated refactoring platform for the Java language. It can apply a range of refactorings, supports several search types, and implements over 25 software quality metrics which can be combined in various ways to form a fitness function. The original goal of the Code-Imp project was to investigate the use of automated refactoring to improve software quality as expressed by a contemporary metrics suite. In this paper we present a technical overview of the Code-Imp implementation, and summarise three active research strands involving Code-Imp: refactoring for testability, metrics exploration, and multi-level design improvement."

  "Abstract": "In December of 2010, the new game CityVille achieved 6 million daily active users in just 8 days. Clearly the success of CityVille owes something to the fun gameplay experience it provides. That said, it was far from the best game released in 2010. Why did it grow so fast? In this talk the key factors behind the dramatic success of social network games are explained. Social network games build word-of-mouth player acquisition directly into the gameplay experience via friend invitations and game mechanics that require contributions by friends to succeed. Software analytics (mined data about player sessions) yield detailed models of factors that affect player retention and engagement. Player engagement is directly related to conversion, shifting a free player into a paying player, the critical move in a freemium business model. Analytics also permit tracking of player virality, the degree to which one player invites other players into the game. \nSocial network games offer multiple lessons for software engineers in general, and software mining researchers in particular. Since software is in competition for people&#8217;s attention along with a wide range of other media and software, it is important to design software for high engagement and retention. Retention engineering requires constant attention to mined user experience data, and this data is easiest to acquire with web-based software. Building user acquisition directly into software provides powerful benefits, especially when it is integrated deeply into the experience delivered by the software. Since retention engineering and viral user acquisition are much easier with web-based software, the trend of software applications migrating to the web will accelerate."

In 2004, motivated from some previous research work that pointed out copy-pasting as a major reason for majority of the bugs in device driver code, my students and I applied data mining technology (specifically frequent subsequence mining algorithms) in identifying copy-pasted code and also detecting forget-to-change bugs introduced during copy-pasting. The benefit of using data mining is that it is highly scalable (20 minutes for 4-5 millions lines of code), and can tolerate changes such as statement insertion/deletion/modification as well as variable name changes. When we released our tool called CP-Miner to the open source community, it attracted some inquiries from industry. These inquiries have motivated us to start a company to commercialize our tools."

Researchers and language designers anticipated this addition would relieve many long-standing problems plaguing developers, but surprisingly, no one has yet measured whether generics actually provide such relief. In this paper, we report on the first empirical investigation into how Java generics have been integrated into open source software by automatically mining the history of 20 popular open source Java programs, traversing more than 500 million lines of code in the process. We evaluate five hypotheses, each based on assertions made by prior researchers, about how Java developers use generics. For example, our results suggest that generics do not significantly reduce the number of type casts and that generics are usually adopted by a single champion in a project, rather than all committers."

Based on the revision data of 22 OSS projects, we tracked the evolution of language usage and other artefacts such as documentation files, binaries and graphics files. In these systems several different languages and artefact types including C/C++, Java, XML, XSL, Makefile, Groovy, HTML, Shell scripts, CSS, Graphics files, JavaScript, JSP, Ruby, Phyton, XQuery, OpenDocument files, PHP, etc. have been used. We found that the amount of code written in different languages differs substantially. Some of our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) JavaScript and CSS files most often co-evolve with XSL; (2) Most Java developers but only every second C/C++ developer work with XML; (3) and more generally, we observed a significant increase of usage of XML and XSL during recent years and found that Java or C are hardly ever the only language used by a developer. In fact, a developer works with more than 5 different artefact types (or 4 different languages) in a project on average."

  "Abstract": "The dynamic and reflective features of programming languages are powerful constructs that programmers often mention as extremely useful. However, the ability to modify a program at runtime can be both a boon---in terms of flexibility---, and a curse---in terms of tool support. For instance, usage of these features hampers the design of type systems, the accuracy of static analysis techniques, or the introduction of optimizations by compilers. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of a large Smalltalk codebase---often regarded as the poster-child in terms of availability of these features---, in order to assess how much these features are actually used in practice, whether some are used more than others, and in which kinds of projects. These results are useful to make informed decisions about which features to consider when designing language extensions or tool support."

This paper reports a study of identifier renamings in software systems, studying how terms (identifier atomic components) change in source code identifiers. Specifically, the paper (i) proposes a term renaming taxonomy, (ii) presents an approximate lightweight code analysis approach to detect and classify term renamings automatically into the taxonomy dimensions, and (iii) reports an exploratory study of term renamings in two open-source systems, Eclipse-JDT and Tomcat. We thus report evidence that not only synonyms are involved in renamings but also (in a small fraction) more unexpected changes occur: surprisingly, we detected hypernym (a more abstract term, e.g., size vs. length) and hyponym (a more concrete term, e.g., restriction vs. rule) renamings, and antonym renamings (a term replaced with one having the opposite meaning, e.g., closing vs. opening). Despite being only a fraction of all renamings, synonym, hyponym, hypernym, and antonym renamings may hint at some program understanding issues and, thus, could be used in a renaming-recommendation system to improve code quality."

  "Abstract": "From the standpoint of retrieval from large software libraries for the purpose of bug localization, we compare five generic text models and certain composite variations thereof. The generic models are: the Unigram Model (UM), the Vector Space Model (VSM), the Latent Semantic Analysis Model (LSA), the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model (LDA), and the Cluster Based Document Model (CBDM). The task is to locate the files that are relevant to a bug reported in the form of a textual description by a software user/developer. We use for our study iBUGS, a benchmarked bug localization dataset with 75 KLOC and a large number of bugs (291). A major conclusion of our comparative study is that simple text models such as UM and VSM are more effective at correctly retrieving the relevant files from a library as compared to the more sophisticated models such as LDA. The retrieval effectiveness for the various models was measured using the following two metrics: (1) Mean Average Precision; and (2) Rank-based metrics. Using the SCORE metric, we also compare the retrieval effectiveness of the models in our study with some other bug localization tools."

  "Abstract": "Identifying refactorings in software archives has been an active research topic in the last decade, mainly because it is a prerequisite for various software evolution analyses (e.g., error detection, capturing intent of change, capturing and replaying changes, and relating refactorings and software metrics). Many of these techniques rely on similarity measures to identify structurally equivalent code, however, up until now the effect of this similarity measure on the performance of the refactoring identification algorithm is largely unexplored. In this paper we replicate a well-known experiment from Weissgerber and Diehl, plugging in three different similarity measures (text-based, AST-based, token-based). We look at the overlap of the results obtained by the different metrics, and we compare the results using recall and the computation time. We conclude that the different result sets have a large overlap and that the three metrics perform with a comparable quality."

For instance, many consumer devices have firmware containing the Linux kernel, without the suppliers following the requirements of the GNU General Public License. Such license violations are often accidental, e.g., when vendors receive binary code from their suppliers with no indication of its provenance. To help find such violations, we have developed the Binary Analysis Tool (BAT), a system for code clone detection in binaries. Given a binary, such as a firmware image, it attempts to detect cloning of code from repositories of packages in source and binary form. We evaluate and compare the effectiveness of three of BAT's clone detection techniques: scanning for string literals, detecting similarity through data compression, and detecting similarity by computing binary deltas."

  "Abstract": "Software readability is a property that influences how easily a given piece of code can be read and understood. Since readability can affect maintainability, quality, etc., programmers are very concerned about the readability of code. If automatic readability checkers could be built, they could be integrated into development tool-chains, and thus continually inform developers about the readability level of the code. Unfortunately, readability is a subjective code property, and not amenable to direct automated measurement. In a recently published study, Buse et al. asked 100 participants to rate code snippets by readability, yielding arguably reliable mean readability scores of each snippet; they then built a fairly complex predictive model for these mean scores using a large, diverse set of directly measurable source code properties. We build on this work: we present a simple, intuitive theory of readability, based on size and code entropy, and show how this theory leads to a much sparser, yet statistically significant, model of the mean readability scores produced in Buse's studies. Our model uses well-known size metrics and Halstead metrics, which are easily extracted using a variety of tools. We argue that this approach provides a more theoretically well-founded, practically usable, approach to readability measurement."

  "Abstract": "A significant amount of research effort has been dedicated to learning prediction models that allow project managers to efficiently allocate resources to those parts of a software system that most likely are bug-prone and therefore critical. Prominent measures for building bug prediction models are product measures, e.g., complexity or process measures, such as code churn. Code churn in terms of lines modified (LM) and past changes turned out to be significant indicators of bugs. However, these measures are rather imprecise and do not reflect all the detailed changes of particular source code entities during maintenance activities. In this paper, we explore the advantage of using fine-grained source code changes (SCC) for bug prediction. SCC captures the exact code changes and their semantics down to statement level. We present a series of experiments using different machine learning algorithms with a dataset from the Eclipse platform to empirically evaluate the performance of SCC and LM. The results show that SCC outperforms LM for learning bug prediction models."

  "Abstract": "A good understanding of the impact of different types of bugs on various project aspects is essential to improve software quality research and practice. For instance, we would expect that security bugs are fixed faster than other types of bugs due to their critical nature. However, prior research has often treated all bugs as similar when studying various aspects of software quality (e.g., predicting the time to fix a bug), or has focused on one particular type of bug (e.g., security bugs) with little comparison to other types. In this paper, we study how different types of bugs (performance and security bugs) differ from each other and from the rest of the bugs in a software project. Through a case study on the Firefox project, we find that security bugs are fixed and triaged much faster, but are reopened and tossed more frequently. Furthermore, we also find that security bugs involve more developers and impact more files in a project. Our work is the first work to ever empirically study performance bugs and compare it to frequently-studied security bugs. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the different types of bugs in software quality research and practice."

  "Abstract": "Reliability is important to software product-line developers since many product lines require reliable operation. It is typically assumed that as a software product line matures, its reliability improves. Since post-deployment failures impact reliability, we study this claim on an open-source software product line, Eclipse. We investigate the failure trend of common components (reused across all products), high-reuse variation components (reused in five or six products) and low-reuse variation components (reused in one or two products) as Eclipse evolves. We also study how much the common and variation components change over time both in terms of addition of new files and modification of existing files. Quantitative results from mining and analysis of the Eclipse bug and release repositories show that as the product line evolves, fewer serious failures occur in components implementing commonality, and that these components also exhibit less change over time. These results were roughly as expected. However, contrary to expectation, components implementing variations, even when reused in five or more products, continue to evolve fairly rapidly. Perhaps as a result, the number of severe failures in variation components shows no uniform pattern of decrease over time. The paper describes and discusses this and related results."

  "Abstract": "Over the past eight years, Cisco Systems, Inc., has implemented software quality goals for most groups engaged in software development, including development for both customer and internal use. This corporate implementation has proven to be a long and difficult process for many reasons, including opposition from many groups, uncertainties as to how to proceed with key aspects of the goaling, and the many unanticipated modifications needed to adapt the program to a large and diverse development and test environment. This paper describes what has worked, what has not work so well, and what levels of improvement the Engineering organization has experienced in part as a result of these efforts. Key customer experience metrics have improved 30% to 70% over the past six years, partly as a result of metrics and process standardization, dashboarding, and goaling. As one would expect with such a large endeavor, some of the results shown are not statistically provable, but are nevertheless generally accepted within the corporation as valid. Other important results do have strong statistical substantiation, and we will also describe these. But whether or not the results are statistically provable, Cisco has in fact improved its software quality substantially over the past eight years, and the corporate goaling mechanism is generally recognized as having been a necessary (but of course not sufficient) part of this improvement effort."

We analyzed the blogging and the committing behavior of 1,100 developers in four large open source communities. We observed that these communities intensively use blogs with one new entry about every 8 hours. A blog entry includes 14 times more words than a commit message. When analyzing the content of the blogs, we found that most popular topics represent high-level concepts such as functional requirements and domain concepts. Source code related topics are covered in less than 15% of the posts. Our results also show that developers are more likely to blog after corrective engineering and management activities than after forward engineering and re-engineering activities. Our findings call for a hypothesis-driven research to further understand the role of social media in software engineering and integrate it into development processes and tools."

  "Abstract": "The success of an open-source project depends to a large degree on the proactive and constructive participation by the developer community. An important role that developers play in a project is that of a code committer. However, code-commit privilege is typically restricted to the core group of a project. In this paper, we study the phenomenon of the induction of external developers as code committers. The trustworthiness of an external developer is one of the key factors that determines the granting of commit privileges. Therefore, we formulate different hypotheses to explain how the trust is established in practice. To investigate our hypotheses, we developed an automated approach based on mining code repositories and bug-tracking systems. We implemented the approach and performed an empirical study, using the Eclipse projects, to test the hypotheses. Our results indicate that, most frequently, developers establish trust and credibility in a project by contributing to the project in a non-committer role. Moreover, the employing organization of a developer is another factor&#8212;although a less significant one&#8212;that influences trust."

The study shows that the phenomenon of cross-system bug fixing between these two projects occurs often, despite the limited overlap of contributors. The study also shows that cross-system bug fixings mainly involve contributors with the highest degree, betweenness and brokerage level, as well as contributors that change the source code more than others."

Commit metadata is a rich source of social characteristics, including the commit's time of day and the experience and commit frequency of its author.

In this paper, we investigate the correlation between a commit's social characteristics and its \"bugginess\"; such results can be very useful for software developers and software engineering researchers. For instance, developers or code reviewers might be well-advised to thoroughly verify commits that are more likely to be buggy. \nIn this paper, we study the correlation between a commit's bugginess and the time of day of the commit, the day of week of the commit, and the experience and commit frequency of the commit authors. We survey two widely-used open source projects: the Linux kernel and PostgreSQL. \nOur main findings include: (1) commits submitted between midnight and 4 AM (referred to as late-night commits) are significantly buggier and commits between 7 AM and noon are less buggy, implying that developers may want to double-check their own late-night commits; (2) daily-committing developers produce less-buggy commits, indicating that we may want to promote the practice of daily-committing developers reviewing other developers' commits; and (3) the bugginess of commits versus day-of-week varies for different software projects."

However, word-lists are difficult to interpret in the absence of meaningful summary labels. Current topic modeling techniques assume manual labelling and do not use domain-specific knowledge to improve, contextualize, or describe results for the developers. We propose a solution: automated labelled topic extraction. Topics are extracted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) from commit-log comments recovered from source control systems such as CVS and BitKeeper. These topics are given labels from a generalizable cross-project taxonomy, consisting of non-functional requirements. Our approach was evaluated with experiments and case studies on two large-scale RDBMS projects: MySQL and MaxDB. The case studies show that labelled topic extraction can produce appropriate, context-sensitive labels relevant to these projects, which provides fresh insight into their evolving software development activities."

Existing techniques for modeling the evolution of topics in software projects suffer from issues of data duplication, i.e., when the repository contains multiple copies of the same document, as is the case in source code histories. To address this issue, we propose the Diff model, which applies a topic model only to the changes of the documents in each version instead of to the whole document at each version. A comparative study with a state-of-the-art topic evolution model shows that the Diff model can detect more distinct topics as well as more sensitive and accurate topic evolutions, which are both useful for analyzing source code histories."

  "Abstract": "Deployed software systems are typically composed of many pieces, not all of which may have been created by the main development team. Often, the provenance of included components --- such as external libraries or cloned source code --- is not clearly stated, and this uncertainty can introduce technical and ethical concerns that make it difficult for system owners and other stakeholders to manage their software assets. In this work, we motivate the need for the recovery of the provenance of software entities by a broad set of techniques that could include signature matching, source code fact extraction, software clone detection, call flow graph matching, string matching, historical analyses, and other techniques. We liken our provenance goals to that of Bertillonage, a simple and approximate forensic analysis technique based on bio-metrics that was developed in 19th century France before the advent of fingerprints. As an example, we have developed a fast, simple, and approximate technique called anchored signature matching for identifying library version information within a given Java application. This technique involves a type of structured signature matching performed against a database of candidates drawn from the Maven2 repository, a 150GB collection of open source Java libraries. An exploratory case study using a proprietary e-commerce Java application illustrates that the approach is both feasible and effective."

  "Abstract": "Software developers often confront questions such as \"Why was the code implemented this way\"? To answer such questions, developers make use of information in a software system's bug and source repositories. In this paper, we consider two user interfaces for helping a developer explore information from such repositories. One user interface, from Holmes and Begel's Deep Intellisense tool, exposes historical information across several integrated views, favouring exploration from a single code element to all of that element's historical information. The second user interface, in a tool called Rationalizer that we introduce in this paper, integrates historical information into the source code editor, favouring exploration from a particular code line to its immediate history. We introduce a model to express how software repository information is connected and use this model to compare the two interfaces. Through a lab experiment, we found that our model can help predict which interface is helpful for a particular kind of historical question. We also found deficiencies in the interfaces that hindered users in the exploration of historical information. These results can help inform tool developers who are presenting historical information either directly from or mined from software repositories."

One such tool provides part-of-speech information, which finds application in improving the searching of software repositories and extracting domain information found in identifiers. \nUnfortunately, the natural language found is software differs from that found in standard prose. This difference potentially limits the effectiveness of off-the-shelf tools. An empirical investigation finds that with minimal guidance an existing tagger was correct 88% of the time when tagging the words found in source code identifiers. The investigation then uses the improved part-of-speech information to tag a large corpus of over 145,000 structure-field names. From patterns in the tags several rules emerge that seek to understand past usage and to improve future naming."

  "Abstract": "Predicting bug-fix time is useful in several areas of software evolution, such as predicting software quality or coordinating development effort during bug triaging. Prior work has proposed bug-fix time prediction models that use various bug report attributes (e.g., number of developers who participated in fixing the bug, bug severity, number of patches, bug-opener's reputation) for estimating the time it will take to fix a newly-reported bug. In this paper we take a step towards constructing more accurate and more general bug-fix time prediction models by showing how existing models fail to validate on large projects widely-used in bug studies. In particular, we used multivariate and univariate regression testing to test the prediction significance of existing models on 512,474 bug reports from five open source projects: Eclipse, Chrome and three products from the Mozilla project (Firefox, Seamonkey and Thunderbird). The results of our regression testing indicate that the predictive power of existing models is between 30% and 49% and that there is a need for more independent variables (attributes) when constructing a prediction model. Additionally, we found that, unlike in prior recent studies on commercial software, in the projects we examined there is no correlation between bug-fix likelihood, bug-opener's reputation and the time it takes to fix a bug. These findings indicate three open research problems: (1) assessing whether prioritizing bugs using bug-opener's reputation is beneficial, (2) identifying attributes which are effective in predicting bug-fix time, and (3) constructing bug-fix time prediction models which can be validated on multiple projects."

Semantic Web technologies have been used successfully in a wide array of domains such as health care and life sciences as a platform for information integration and knowledge management. The success is largely due to the open and extensible nature of ontology languages as well as growing tool support. We believe that Semantic Web technologies represent an ideal platform for the integration of software engineering data in a semantic repository. By querying and analyzing such a repository, researchers and practitioners can better understand and control software engineering activities and processes.

Mean time to close problem reports is the most commonly used efficiency measure, but its suitability has not been evaluated carefully. We performed such an evaluation by mining and analyzing many years of support data on multiple IBM products. Our preliminary results suggest that the mean is less sensitive and accurate than another measure, percentiles, in cases that are particularly important in the maintenance and support domain. Using percentiles, we also identified statistical techniques to detect efficiency trends and evaluated their accuracy. Although preliminary, these results may have significant ramifications for effectively measuring and improving software maintenance and support processes."

  "Abstract": "The FixCache algorithm, introduced in 2007, effectively identifies files or methods which are likely to contain bugs by analyzing source control repository history. However, many open questions remain about the behaviour of this algorithm. What is the variation in the hit rate over time? How long do files stay in the cache? Do buggy files tend to stay buggy, or can they be redeemed? This paper analyzes the behaviour of the FixCache algorithm on four open source projects. FixCache hit rate is found to generally increase over time for three of the four projects; file duration in cache follows a Zipf distribution; and topmost bug-fixed files go through periods of greater and lesser stability over a project&#8217;s history."

  "Authors": ["Brandon Heller", "Eli Marschner", "Evan Rosenfeld", "Jeffrey Heer"],
  "Affiliations": ["Stanford University, USA"],
  "Abstract": "We apply visualization techniques to user profiles and repository metadata from the GitHub source code hosting service. Our motivation is to identify patterns within this development community that might otherwise remain obscured. Such patterns include the effect of geographic distance on developer relationships, social connectivity and influence among cities, and variation in project-specific contribution styles (e.g., centralized vs. distributed). Our analysis examines directed graphs in which nodes represent users' geographic locations and edges represent (a) follower relationships, (b) successive commits, or (c) contributions to the same project. We inspect this data using a set of visualization techniques: geo-scatter maps, small multiple displays, and matrix diagrams. Using these representations, and tools based on them, we develop hypotheses about the larger GitHub community that would be difficult to discern using traditional lists, tables, or descriptive statistics. These methods are not intended to provide conclusive answers; instead, they provide a way for researchers to explore the question space and communicate initial insights."

  "Abstract": "The MSR Challenge aims at offering researchers and practitioners in the area of Mining Software Repositories a shared set of software repositories, enabling them to compare their tools and approaches. This year, the main theme of the challenge was on the comparison of projects. We selected four open source projects, and challenged participants to use their brains, tools, computational power, and magic to compare them and uncover interesting similarities and differences. The projects were Eclipse and Netbeans, two popular IDEs written in Java (Group 1) and Firefox and Chrome, two web browsers written in C/C++ (Group 2). We encouraged participants to analyze more than one project, ideally in the same group but allowed them to analyze a single project."

  "Abstract": "Eclipse and Netbeans are two top of the line Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for Java development. Both of them provide support for a wide variety of development tasks and have a large user base. This paper provides an analysis and comparison for the compatibility and stability of Eclipse and Netbeans on the three most commonly used operating systems, Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Both IDEs are programmed in Java and use a Bugzilla issue tracker to track reported bugs and feature requests. We looked into the Bugzilla repository databases of these two IDEs, which contains the bug records and histories of these two IDEs. We used some basic data mining techniques to analyze some historical statistics of the bug data. Based on the analysis, we try to answer certain stability-comparison oriented questions in the paper, so that users can have a better idea which of these two IDEs is designed better to work on different platforms."

  "Abstract": "Firefox and Chrome are two very popular open source Web browsers, implemented in C/C++. This paper analyzes what topics were discussed in Firefox and Chrome bug reports over time. To this aim, we indexed the text contained in bug reports submitted each semester of the project history, and identified topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Then, we investigated to what extent Firefox and Chrome developers/contributors discussed similar topics, either in different periods, or over the same period. Results indicate a non-negligible overlap of topics, mainly on issues related to page layouting, user interaction, and multimedia contents."

  "Abstract": "We explore the space of open source systems and their user communities by examining the development artifact histories of two popular web browsers - Firefox and Chrome - as well as usage data. By examining the data and addressing a number of research questions, two very different profiles emerge: Firefox, as the older and established system, with long product version cycles but short bug fix cycles, and a user base that is slow to adopt newer versions; and Chrome, as the new and fast evolving system, with short version cycles, longer bug fix cycles, and a user base that very quickly adopts new versions as they become available (due largely to Chrome's mandatory automatic updates)."

  "Authors": ["Yukinao Hirata", "Osamu Mizuno"],

  "Abstract": "Comment lines in the software source code include descriptions of codes, usage of codes, copyrights, unused codes, comments, and so on. It is required for comments to explain the content of written code adequately, since the wrong description in the comment may causes further bug and confusion in maintenance. \nIn this paper, we try to clarify a research question: ``In which projects do comments describe the code adequately?'' To answer this question, we selected the group 1 of mining challenge and used data obtained from Eclipse and Netbeans. Since it is difficult to answer the above question directly, we define the distance between codes and comments. By utilizing the fault-prone module prediction technique, we can answer the alternative question from the data of two projects. The result shows that Eclipse project has relatively adequate comments."

  "Abstract" : "In January 2011, President Obama signed the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act into law. The Act asks the NSF to apply the Broader Impact review criterion to achieve a number of societal goals and to implement a plan for achieving this within six months of the Act becoming law. Thus, NSF has been mandated to take Broader Impacts even more seriously than before. The clock has been ticking since January, and by the time ICSE is held, NSF's procedures will be only two months away from changing. This session's goal would be to define the five different ways the criteria can be fulfilled (only one of which is outreach), with many examples and strategies that should be easily within the comfort zones and means of almost any US software engineering researcher."

  "Abstract" : "Half of the people who attended the first ICSE in 1975 came from industry, but by 2010, industry participation was less than 20%.  This lack of participation hurts both sides: researchers have fewer insights on the problems that are important to practitioners, while practitioners fail to learn what researchers have already discovered that might be useful to them.\n\nSince the publication of \"Making Software\" in 2010, editor Greg Wilson and the other organizers of this panel have sought to close this gap between industry and research.  We started by interviewing leading practitioners in industry to find out what questions they want answered, and what kinds of answers they will find compelling as evidence.  At this panel, representatives from the software industry and professionals that straddle the line between research and practice will use the findings from our interviews as a starting point for discussion and will explore how to bring theory and practice back together."

  "Authors": ["Kumiyo Nakakoji"],
  "Affiliations": ["Software Research Associates Inc."],
  "Abstract": "The design and development of a software system deals with both the world of making and that of using. The world of making is concerned with molding, constructing and building. The world of using is concerned with engaging, experiencing, and interacting-with. The two worlds are structurally, semantically, and temporally intertwined through software programs.\n\nDesigning the world of using requires painstaking efforts toward envisioning all the possible situations of use for all the possible types of users in all the possible contexts, in various temporal and situational levels of granularity, to create a coherent and convivial user experience of using the system. Identifying typical use scenarios or depicting snapshots of crucial usage situations does not suffice to frame the world of using. Thorough analyses of the possible flows of interactions over a long period of time through the dynamism of user engagement and experience are essential in framing the world of using. \n\nThrough the delineation of previous and current work on designing and developing research prototype tools for creative knowledge activities, observing and analyzing interaction design processes, and directing user experience design teams for consumer products, this talk will address the expression, representation, communication and assessment of the design of the world of using from the perspectives of interactivity, continuity, sketching and experience."

  "Abstract": "Design and design thinking are becoming the hot topics and new business processes around the world--yes, business processes! Business schools are adding design thinking courses to their curricula and business professors are writing books on design thinking. Countries like Korea and Singapore are vying to be the leading Asian Design Nations. New, socalled Convergent courses, programs and schools are emerging globally that combine engineering, business and design disciplines and departments into integrated efforts. The Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Design Movement is gaining momentum and the personal discipline of Making things is coming back. DIY Prototyping and Manufacturing are gaining ground and opportunities with new technologies and innovations. User- Generated Design is becoming a common corporate process. Design process and design thinking are being applied cross-functionally to such global issues as clean water and alternative energy. And the old traditional view of design as art and decoration and styling is giving way to a broader and more comprehensive way of thinking and solving human-centered problems by other than just a few elite professionals. \n\n In light of all this and more, Bill is excited about the ideas of ubiquitous design education for everyone and DIY design as a universal human experience. He is passionate about an idea in what Victor Papanek said 40 years ago in his seminal book, Design for the Real World, &#8220;All that we do, almost all the time, is design, for design is basic to all human activity&#8221;. Just as all humans are inherently businesspeople in many ways at many times, we are also all designers in many ways at many times&#8212;it is time to believe this and make the best of it."

Thus understanding cooperative and human aspects of software development is crucial to comprehend how methods and tools are used, and thereby improve the creation and maintenance of software. Over the years, both researchers and practitioners have recognized the need to study and understand these aspects. Despite recognizing this, researchers in cooperative and human aspects have no clear place to meet and are dispersed in different research conferences and areas. The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussing high quality research on human and cooperative aspects of software engineering. We aim at providing both a meeting place for the growing community and the possibility for researchers interested in joining the field to present their work in progress and get an overview over the field.",

Foundational materials presented will include pedagogical materials and infrastructure developed and used in teaching DSD courses (by the organizers and participants) along with results and lessons learned. Long-range goals include: lowering adoption barriers by providing common pedagogical materials, validated collaboration infrastructure, and a pool of potential teaching partners from around the globe.",

This complexity creates difficulties architecting components, predicting their behaviors and testing the results. Software engineering hasn't yet been able to meet the demands of the games industry, an industry that works at the forefront of technology and creativity, where creating a fun experience is the most important metric of success. GAS 2011 will explore the demands of game creation and ascertain how the software engineering community can contribute to this important creative domain. Furthermore, GAS 2011 will investigate how games can help aid the software engineering process or improve software engineering education. Research in these areas has been exciting and interesting, and GAS 2011 will be the first time practitioners from all three fields to have the opportunity to come together at ICSE to investigate the possibilities of this innovative research area.",

  "Abstract": "Multicore processors are ubiquitous and every new computer is a truly parallel machine. This is a fundamental change in the history of computing: parallelism is not confined to scientific applications any more but becomes available for everyone at low cost. Everyday applications and industry applications will need to be parallel in order to exploit the full hardware potential. As a consequence, software engineers now face the challenge of parallelizing applications of all sorts. Compared to sequential applications, our repertoire of tools and methods for cost-effectively developing reliable and robust parallel applications is spotty. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners with diverse backgrounds in order to advance the state of the art in multicore software engineering.",

  "Abstract": "The technical debt metaphor is gaining significant traction in the software development community as a way to understand and communicate issues of intrinsic quality, value, and cost. The idea is that developers sometimes accept compromises in a system in one dimension (e.g., modularity) to meet an urgent demand in some other dimension (e.g., a deadline), and that such compromises incur a &#8220;debt&#8221;: on which &#8220;interest&#8221; has to be paid and which should be repaid at some point for the long-term health of the project. Little is known about technical debt, beyond feelings and opinions. The software engineering research community has an opportunity to study this phenomenon and improve the way it is handled. We can offer software engineers a foundation for managing such trade-offs based on models of their economic impacts. The goal of this second workshop is to discuss managing technical debt as a part of the research agenda for the software engineering field.",

  "Abstract": "Service-oriented systems represent a new class of software system in which software is being used and integrated as external, loosely-coupled services rather than being physically integrated and owned permanently.  Service-oriented systems provide a more flexible approach to software development, provisioning and maintenance because services offer reusable functionality that can be combined to support business processes (or similar) that are dynamic by nature.  This enables the adaptation to changes in a system's environment as well as to the continuously evolving system requirements that are commonplace today.  However, service orientation poses challenges to more traditional approaches to software development, stemming from the lack of homogeneity of its basic components and from the requirement of being able to accommodate changes and dynamic evolution right from the beginning.  In this respect, the workshop aims at finding possibilities of synergy between Software Engineering (SE) technologies and Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) that are beneficial to both fields.",

  "Abstract": "By adopting Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) practices, organizations can achieve significant improvement in time-to-market, engineering and maintenance costs, portfolio size, and quality. However, despite the known benefits of SPLE over traditional reuse approaches, SPLE is still in the early adopter stage.\n\nThe main goal of PLEASE is to bring together industrial practitioner and software product line researchers in order to couple real-life industrial problems with concrete solutions. We plan for a 2-day highly interactive event in which concrete solutions will be proposed for the identified industrial problems. Besides promoting SPLE adoption, this will also allow validating existing techniques developed by the research community and identifying unresolved problems in the SPLE area. As the result, we will be able to feed researchers with real-life industrial SPLE problems and to establish agenda for future research. These goals are in the spirit of moving researchers and industrial practitioners into Pasteur's Quadrant.\n\nThis event will also allow industrial practitioners to learn from each other's experience and to establish long lasting collaboration between the industry and research. Towards this end, we will also discuss and establish measures of progress and benefits from applying different solutions.",

  "Abstract": "Cloud Computing has engendered a disruptive change in the requirements, architecture, implementation and evolution methodologies for software &#8211; in short, it has challenged our thinking as software engineering (SE) researchers and practitioners in ways that we as a community are still scrambling to find out.\n\nWhether you are interested in Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) such as Amazon Web Services, or AWS; platform-as-a-service (PaaS) including Google App Engine or Azure; software-as-a-service (SaaS) e.g., salesforce.com; or in frameworks that enable the above like Apache Hadoop or Microsoft&#8217;s Dryad, we feel that the time is ripe to rethink SE foundations in light of the cloud.\n\nThe SECLOUD workshop will focus on identifying the SE for cloud 'grand challenges' that lay before us. We will debate existing notions of SE for the construction of cloud services and for their deployment. We will evangelize success stories and how they were arrived at. We anticipate as outcomes the definition of a long-term concrete SE research agenda for cloud, and the sharing of existing SE for cloud &#8220;tribal knowledge&#8221; that can be applied in the short-term.",

  "Abstract": "Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) software supports a wide variety of domains including nuclear physics, crash simulation, satellite data processing, fluid dynamics, climate modeling, bioinformatics, and vehicle development. The increase in the importance of CSE software motivates the need to identify and understand appropriate software engineering (SE) practices for CSE. Because of the uniqueness of CSE software development, existing SE tools and techniques developed for the business/IT community are often not efficient or effective. Appropriate SE solutions must account for the salient characteristics of the CSE development environment. This situation creates an opportunity for members of the SE community to interact with members of the CSE community to address this need. This workshop facilitates that collaboration by bringing together members of the SE community and the CSE community to share perspectives and present findings from research and practice relevant to CSE software. A significant portion of the workshop is devoted to focused interaction among the participants with the goal of generating a research agenda to improve tools, techniques, and experimental methods for studying CSE software engineering.",

  "Abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a fundamental building-block of the upcoming Internet of Things, as they enable seamless integration of the digital and physical worlds. Despite the interest raised by this decade-old research topic, the development of WSN software is still carried out in a rather primitive fashion, by building software directly atop the operating system and by relying on the individual, hard-earned programming skills. Software engineering (SE) support is therefore sought, not only to ease the development task but also to make it more reliable, dependable, and repeatable.\n\nThe aim of SESENA11 is to attract researchers belonging to both the SE and WSN communities, not only to exchange their recent research results on the topic, but also to stimulate discussion about the core open problems and to define a shared research agenda. The workshop welcomes both research contributions and position statements. SESENA11 will also include a 'speakers corner' session composed by impromptu presentations where any of the attendees will be given a chance to present their own views in very short bouts.",

In fact, software is at core of most of the business transactions and its smart integration in an industrial setting may be the competitive advantage even when the core competence is outside the ICT field. As a result, the revenues of a firm depend directly on several complex software-based systems. Thus, stakeholders and users should be able to trust these systems to provide data and elaborations with a degree of confidentiality, integrity, and availability compatible with their needs. Moreover, the pervasiveness of software products in the creation of critical infrastructures has raised the value of trustworthiness and new efforts should be dedicated to achieve it. However, nowadays almost every application has some kind of security requirement even if its use is not to be considered critical.",

Architectural Knowledge (AK) is the integrated representation of the software architecture of a software-intensive system (or a family of systems), the architectural design decisions, and the external context/environment. It is recognized as the means for architecture governance; it facilitates and supports collaboration and the transfer of expertise.\n\nIn this sixth SHARK edition we will investigate the approaches for AK personalization, where knowledge is not codified through templates or annotations, but it is exchanged through the discussion between the different stakeholders. Therefore, the emphasis does not lie on resource-intensive documentation but on lightweight, just-in-time conversations facilitated by 'knowledge yellow pages' (who knows what). The AK community has not explored AK personalization in depth, even though it has acknowledged its value as a viable approach.\n\nIn good tradition, SHARK aims to bring together researchers and practitioners that are interested in sharing and reusing architectural knowledge. The workshop will kick-start with short position statements from the paper authors. The main focus will be on fostering creative discussion between the participants, on specific themes.",

  "Abstract": "Our knowledge as to how to solve software engineering problems is increasingly being encapsulated in tools. These tools are at their strongest when they operate in a pre-existing development environment that can provide integration with existing elements such as compilers, debuggers, profilers and visualizers. Some also exist beyond development time and work with the runtime. A further challenge is to develop tools that can span different &#8211; and future - development environments and runtimes. This workshop should of interest to all those interested in developing tools as plug-ins for IDEs, runtimes and browsers. We will examine the categories of problems that are best solved in this way, and look at the future challenges. Attendees should have a working knowledge of an IDE such as Visual Studio 2010, Eclipse or MonoDevelop, and experience or interest in tool development.",

  "Abstract": "Social software is built around an 'architecture of participation' where user data is aggregated as a side-effect of using Web 2.0 applications. Web 2.0 implies that processes and tools are socially open, and that content can be used in several different contexts. Web 2.0 tools and technologies support interactive information sharing, data interoperability and user centered design. For instance, wikis, blogs, tags and feeds help us organize, manage and categorize content in an informal and collaborative way. Some of these technologies have made their way into collaborative software development processes and development platforms. These processes and environments are just scratching the surface of what can be done by incorporating Web 2.0 approaches and technologies into collaborative software development. Web 2.0 opens up new opportunities for developers to form teams and collaborate, but it also comes with challenges for developers and researchers. Web2SE aims to improve our understanding of how Web 2.0, manifested in technologies such as mashups or dashboards, can change the culture of collaborative software development.",

  "Abstract": "While there is a great deal of interest in developing tool support for refactoring, researchers and tool vendors rarely work together. This forum will enable the transfer of ideas and expertise both ways: researchers can show the state-of-the-art analyses they are using in developing tool support for refactoring, and tool vendors can offer valuable insights on the challenges of scaling such analyses to realistic applications. By bringing together researchers and tool vendors we can shorten the time to embody ideas into production systems. In addition, by making researchers aware of what others are working on, the potential for reinventing the wheel is reduced while the potential for creative collaboration is enhanced.This workshop is the next step in our ongoing effort to create such a community, building on our successful refactoring workshops at ECOOP 2007 and OOPSLA 2008.",

  "Abstract": "During the exploratory phases of design, it is more common to use white boards, pen and paper or other informal mechanisms than modeling tools. During the early stages of requirements engineering, it is more common to use office tools. These informal approaches are easy to learn and give the user great freedom, among other advantages. Yet, as in many other tasks throughout the software lifecycle, the advantages of modeling tools would be valuable too: multiple views, providing domain-specific assistance, ensuring consistency, etc.\n\nFormal modeling tools and more informal but flexible, free-form approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses. Whichever practitioners choose for a particular task, they lose the advantages of the other, with attendant frustration and loss of productivity. What can be done about this unfortunate dichotomy? Flexible modeling tools that blend the advantages of modeling tools and the more free-form approaches would allow users to make tradeoffs between flexibility and precision/formality and to move smoothly between them. They might be modeling tools with added flexibility, or office tools with added modeling support, or tools of a new kind.\n\nThe focus of the workshop will be on challenge problems in the area of flexible modeling. In burgeoning fields, it is valuable for the community to identify key, difficult problems that help to define the research area and serve as a means of evaluating the the success of proposed solutions in that area. The concrete goals of this workshop are to identify a foundational set of challenges and concerns for the field of flexible modeling, and promising directions for addressing each. To that end, it will bring together people who understand tool users' needs, usability, user interface design and tool infrastructure.",
